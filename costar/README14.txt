W4W_SHIP.14\README14.txt
==========================

This is for Version 1.4 of Co*STAR only.

This area is setup to create W4W diskettes.

From this area you can create two kinds of kits; a "Release" kit
or an "Update" kit.  

To create a "Release" kit you must have a W4W 1.3.4 licensed diskette
from Clearview.

To install an "Update" kit, the machine must already be licensed 
for W4W.

Contents:
---------
COSTAR.14    - The Co*STAR verion 1.4 files
W4WDISK1.REL - The W4W files that go onto Disk 1 (Release)
W4WDISK1.UPD - The W4W files that go onto Disk 1 (Update)
W4WDISK2     - The W4W files that go onto Disk 2

Instructions:
-------------
To "Copy the contents" of a directory you go into the directory
then Select All from the Edit menu then copy the selected files
to the floppy.

Creating a "Release" Kit:
-------------------------
To create a kit you must have a W4W 1.4 diskette from Clearview and
one blank formatted diskette.

- Copy the contents of W4WDISK1.REL onto Disk 1 (the disk from 
  Clearview) and select "YES" when prompted if you want to REPLACE 
  existing files.

- Copy the contents of W4WDISK2 onto Disk 2 (a blank formatted disk).

Write protect disk 2 and put an "W4W disk 2" label on it.  Disk 1 must
be left unprotected to install the license. 


Creating an "Update" Kit:
-------------------------
The kit goes onto two diskettes so have two blank formatted
diskettes ready.

- Copy the contents of COSTAR.14 onto Disk 1.

- Copy the contents of W4WDISK1.UPD onto Disk 1 and select "YES"
  when prompted if you want to REPLACE existing files.

- Copy the contents of W4WDISK2 onto Disk 2.

Write protect both disks and put labels on them.

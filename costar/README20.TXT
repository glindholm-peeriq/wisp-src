==========================

This is for Version 2.0 of Co*STAR 32 only.

This area is setup to create W4W diskettes.

From this area you can create two kinds of kits; a "Release" kit
or an "Update" kit.  

To create a "Release" kit you must have a Co*STAR for WISP v2.0 
licensed diskette from Clearview.

To install an "Update" kit, the machine must already be licensed 
for W4W.  *** UPDATE KITS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ***

Contents:
---------
COSTAR32.20A - The Co*STAR 32 verion 2.0a files
W4WDISK1.REL - The W4W files that go onto Disk 1 (Release)
W4WDISK1.UPD - The W4W files that go onto Disk 1 (Update)
W4WDISK2     - The W4W files that go onto Disk 2

Instructions:
-------------
To "Copy the contents" of a directory you go into the directory
then Select All from the Edit menu then copy the selected files
to the floppy.

Creating a "Release" Kit:
-------------------------
To create a kit you must have a Co*STAR for WISP diskette from 
Clearview and one blank formatted diskette.

- Copy the contents of W4WDISK1.REL onto Disk 1 (the disk from 
  Clearview) and select "YES" when prompted if you want to REPLACE 
  existing files.

- Copy the contents of W4WDISK2 onto Disk 2 (a blank formatted disk).

Write protect disk 2 and put an "Co*STAR for WISP disk 2" label on it.  
Disk 1 must be left unprotected to install the license.

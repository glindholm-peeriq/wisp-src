ToDo:
- test Packed-Decimal data types (cannot generate with CREATE)


SSB Procedure Issues:
- ELPBCHKM.WPS: FUNCTION=MERGE with REPLACE=YES
- ELPBCHKM.WPS: Has "ENTER PAD" - unknown "PAD" getparm
- The only field types I find are "C" and "P"

Limitations:
- Only INDEXED and FIXED files are supported FILETYPE=I or F
- For FIXED filetype the RECSIZE must be supplied
- For KEYS data types (TYPEx) code "D" is not supported.
- Only Consecutive Fixed lenght output files are supported

- OPTIONS: MEMORY=xxxx is ignored
- OPTIONS: ADDROUT=YES is not supported
- OPTIONS: KEYOUT=YES is not supported
- OPTIONS: ALTSEQ=NONE is the only supported value
- INPUT:   SHARED=YES is ignored
- INPUT:   DEVICE=xxx is ignored
- INPUT:   FILESEQ=x is ignored
- INPUT:   RECORDS=xxx is ignored
- SELECT:  FLDTYPx=D is not supported 
- KEYS:    TYPEx=D is not supported
- FORMAT:  Limited to 100 fields (MAXREFORMATFIELDS)
- OUTPUT:  FILEORG=C is the only supported value
- OUTPUT:  IPACK=xxx is ignored
- OUTPUT:  DPACK=xxx is ignored
- OUTPUT:  RECSIZE=xxxx cannot be modified (except by REFORMAT=YES)
- OUTPUT:  RECTYPE=V is ignored (always creates Fixed length output)
- OUTPUT:  COMPRESS=YES is ignored
- OUTPUT:  DEVICE=xxx is ignored
- OUTPUT:  FILESEQ=x is ignored

Test Cases:

	OPEN I-O EXCLUSIVE DIRECTIVES
	=============================
	
	This document describes 2 new WISP translator directives that are
	used with VMS (and AcuCOBOL) to make OPEN I-O exclusive.

	The reason for these directives is to improve performance of converted
	software on VMS.


	Wang VS COBOL vs ANSI COBOL
	---------------------------

	On Wang VS COBOL when you need to open a file for reading and writing
	you have 2 options; OPEN I-O or OPEN SHARED.  These will open the
	file for exclusive use or shared use respectively.  On ANSI COBOL
	this translates into ALLOWING NO OTHERS and ALLOWING WRITERS. 
	However ANSI COBOL provides a third option which is ALLOWING READERS
	which gives you exclusive write access but does allow others to
	read the file.

	WISP Translation of OPEN I-O
	----------------------------

	The WISP translator will by default use the ALLOWING READERS clause 
	when it translates an OPEN I-O statement for VMS (or AcuCOBOL).  This
	was found necessary on VMS because of the strict locking which is
	enforced by RMS.  If a file was opened with the ALLOWING NO OTHERS
	clause then calls to READFDR would fail because the file could not
	be read (this doesn't fail on the Wang.)

	New Directives
	--------------

	Two new directives have been added to the WISP translator which
	instruct it to use the ALLOWING NO OTHERS clause when it translates
	an OPEN I-O statement.

	*$OPENIOEXCLUSIVEFILE		Place this before the SELECT 
					statement of a file you want it
					applied to.

	*$OPENIOEXCLUSIVEALL		Place this before the SELECT
					statement and all files that follow
					will be affected.

	Usage Notes
	-----------

	These directives should provide a performance improvement on VMS.
	However, care should be taken in there use as side-effects (like the
	READFDR one described earlier) may occur.

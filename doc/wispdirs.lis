	WISP ON UNIX DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
	================================

OBJECTIVES:
	- Easy handling of the source
	- Building of ship kits
	- Installed version of WISP
	- Reference from a single variable ($WISP)
	- QA testing (ACU and MF)
	- avoid /usr/lib & /usr/include/v  (location independence)


MAKEFILE:
	CFLAGS= -I$(WISP)/src/include -L$(WISP)/src/lib

	include $(WISP)/src/port/make.include

	all:	$(LIB)
		cp $(LIB) $(WISP)/src/lib

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:

	$WISP		- wisp root dir.  i.e.  WISP=/usr2/wisp	
		/wisp				The installed WISP
			/bin
			/lib
			/etc
			/config
				/videocap
			/acu
			/mf
			/ede

		/wisp.QA			Installed WISP for QA.

		/ship.v32
			/wisp
			/rts
			/ede
			/crid

		/src
			/lib			$(STDLIB)
			/ship			Temp ship kit
				/wisp
				/rts
				/ede
				/crid

			/acu
			/ede
			/etc
			/include		$(STDINC)
				/v
			/mf
			/msdos
			/port
			/printq
			/proctran
			/testacu
				/config
					/videocap
				/vol...
			/testmf
				/config
					/videocap
				/vol...
			/videolib
			/videotest
			/videocap
			/wisplib
			/wisptran
			/wisputils

RESULTS:
	$WISP		- All dirs are located via the $WISP variable.

	$WISP/wisp	- This is the "installed" version of WISP it
			  would be write protected.  Beneath it would
			  be a virgin config and videocap dir that
			  can be copied to create a custom config dir.
			  When we upgrade to a new release this dir
			  can be renamed giving it an extension (wisp.v31).

	$WISP/wisp.QA	- An "installed" version of WISP used for QA.
			  It has the same directory structure as $WISP/wisp.
			  It is installed from $WISP/src/ship.

	$WISP/ship.vXX	- These are our ship kits with identifying version
			  numbers as suffixes.

	$WISP/ship.V32/rts
			- The prebuilt ACUCOBOL runtime system. (wruncbl)
			  This previously was included in ship/wisp/bin.
			  It is now only distributed to sites that have
			  signed a release stating that they are lisenced
			  with Acucobol on this platform. (Or demo kits.)

	$WISP/src	- This is the entire source kit.  When we upgrade
			  to a new release this could be renamed giving
			  it a version suffix ($WISP/src.v31) or can
			  be deleted all in one action when needed.
			  Note that both the wisp and video sources
			  are all under this dir with new names.

				NEW			OLD
				$(WISP)/src/wisplib	wisp/lib/src
				$(WISP)/src/videolib	video/lib/src
				$(WISP)/src/videotest	video/test/src
				$(WISP)/src/videocap	video/cap/src

	$WISP/src/lib	- The lib files (libwisp.a etc.) would be copied
			  here instead on /usr/lib.

	$WISP/src/ship	- Place to build a temporary shipping kit for
			  testing WISP.  When QA is done this will be
			  renamed, moved, and protected to be the real
			  shipping kit.

	$WISP/src/include
			- This does **NOT** hold the common headers.
			  It makes the generation and maintainence of
			  the makefiles too difficult to put the common
			  include here.

	$WISP/src/include/v
			- This dir would hold the video headers. This 
			  way we don't need access to /usr/include.

	$WISP/src/port	- This would contain the porting scripts plus 
			  the "make.include" file used in all the make 
			  files.

	$WISP/src/testacu
	$WISP/src/testmf
			- These are the QA directories for ACUCOBOL and
			  Micro Focus COBOL.  They contain the "startup"
			  files needed for QA plus the $WISPCONFIG and
			  "volume" directories.


EXAMPLES:

WISP=/usr2/wisp
PATH=$PATH:$WISP/wisp/bin
WISPCONFIG=$WISP/src/testacu/config

VOL100 /usr2/wisp/src/testacu/vol100

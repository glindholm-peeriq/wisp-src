	IDSI MODIFICATION OF COBOL STANDARDS
	------------------------------------

	Following is the standard way to document a change in clients COBOL
	code.  This method should be used when doing a conversion or demo:

	1 - If modifying the .WCB, ALWAYS leave the original code in the file
	    with a comment character.  This if for reference purposes.

	2 - Document the change as follows:

	12345678901234567890...
	      *%IDSI  brief description of change.
    
	     If multiple lines are needed, make sure there is a comment
	     character in column 7 and indent to the start of the description
	     text.

	     example:
   
	      *%IDSI  Change the PIC 9 field to PIC Z so will display correctly.
	085400*    05  S171D-FLD12  PIC X(02)     ROW 21 COLUMN 30
	085400     05  S171D-FLD12  PIC Z(02)     ROW 21 COLUMN 30

	3 - If use of the *_CODE directives are needed, make sure a descriptive
	    comment is also used with the %IDSI syntax.  The use of the %IDSI
	    syntax is to make searches for IDSI modifications easy and standard.

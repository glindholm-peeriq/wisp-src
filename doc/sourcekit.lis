	HOW TO BUILD A WISP SOURCE KIT ON UNIX
	======================================

	A WISP source kit is a directory tree that contains all the source
	files needed to do a complete port of WISP and build a WISP
	shipping kit.  It is often loaded into one file by CPIO.


	****
	****	THIS STEP IS ONLY DONE ONCE, BY THE PERSON IN CHARGE OF
	****	THE WISP RELEASE -- THAT'S GSL FOR NOW.   IF YOU NEED A
	****	SOURCE KIT ASK HIM.
	****


	STEPS
	=====
	1) Do a WISP cutover first!  A source kit is usually only built
	   after a cutover.  See instructions in "cutover.lis".

	2) Download all relevent files from SCS on SCALOS to HAMMER using
	   the shell script "bldsrckit.sh".   This script can only be run
	   on HAMMER by a user who has privileges to dcp to SCALOS without
	   having to supply a password (i.e. has the correct proxy's on
	   SCALOS.)  The user must also have privileges to read the SCS
	   directories for WISP, VIDEO and PRINTQ.   The script 
	   "bldsrckit.sh" can be found in SCS WISP PORT.

		$ bldsrckit.sh

	   It will prompt you for all needed info and will build the "src"
	   directory tree as described in "wispdirs.lis".

	3) Finalize the kit by doing the following:

		a) Ensure src/port/make.include is in a generic state. I.e.
		   all system dependent info should be in comments.

		b) Download the current release notes into the file
		   src/etc/RELNOTES.

	4) Create a compressed CPIO file.

		$ find src -print | cpio -ocv >src32.cpio
		$ compress src32.cpio

	5) ***OPTIONAL*** build an encrypted source kit

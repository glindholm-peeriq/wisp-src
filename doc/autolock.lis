	WISP/VMS AUTOMATIC RECORD LOCKING
	=================================

	This document applies to WISP for VMS only.

	In order to provide better runtime performance of converted COBOL,
	WISP (3.3c) now defaults to using AUTOMATIC RECORD LOCKING for 
	PRINTER	and SORT files.  This is equivalent to using the WISP 
	directives $AUTOLOCKPRINT for PRINTER files and $AUTOLOCKFILE for 
	SORT files.  (SORT files must be identified to WISP by either the 
	$SORTFILE directive or the #SORT_FILE Options file option.)

	A description of $AUTOLOCKPRINT and $AUTOLOCKFILE can be found in the
	WISP manual under "WISP In-Line DIRECTIVES" page 2-28.

	To allow for backwards compatiblity two new directives have been
	added:

		$NOAUTOLOCKPRINT	- Turns off automatic record locking
					  for all printer files when placed
					  at the beginning of FILE-CONTROL
					  paragraph.

		$NOAUTOLOCKFILE		- Turns off automatic record locking
					  for selected file when place before
					  the SELECT statement.


	AUTOMATIC RECORD LOCKING FOR INDEXED FILES
	==========================================

	WISP (3.3x3) now allows you to specify automatic record locking 
	for INDEXED files that are not opened shared.  This may result in a 
	significant I/O performance improvement and should be considered for 
	all INDEXED work files.  

	Use the $AUTOLOCKFILE file directive in front of the SELECT 
	statements for the files you wish to use automatic record locking.  
	Do not use this directive if the file is opened SHARED (WISP will 
	generate a warning) as the automatic record locking logic will not 
	properly synchronize between processes.

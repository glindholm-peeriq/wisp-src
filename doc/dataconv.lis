	WISP DATA CONVERSION
	====================

	A new feature has been added to WISP to generate a data conversion
	program.  When you WISP with the /DATACONV "-q" option it will
	create a Wang COBOL program with a ".wdc" (Wang Data Conversion)
	file extension.  This program contains routines to convert 
	all the INDEXED and RELATIVE files that were in the original 
	program.  The ".wdc" program is a Wang COBOL program that can 
	then be translated by WISP like any other Wang COBOL program.

	For each file found a corresponding SEQUENTIAL file is added
	with a SELECT and FD that matches the INDEXED file.  The sequential
	file's name and data records are the same as the indexed ones but
	are prefixed with "SEQ-".  In the PROCEDURE DIVISION the SEQENTIAL 
	file is opened for INPUT and the INDEXED file is opened for OUTPUT.
	The logic then reads a records from the	sequential file, moves 
	it to the indexed file's record then write the record.  This
	is repeated until the sequential file gets an EOF.  The number 
	of records read, written and number of invalid keys are then
	displayed.

	If you need to do "data correction" you can edit the ".wdc" file
	and add in your own correction logic.  This is best done in
	the "move" paragraph.  Data correction may consist of fixing
	the "zoned data" fields with a call to "FXZONE" or the changing
	of spaces to zeroes in numeric fields.

	When the data conversion program is run it will prompt you with
	the name of each file and ask if you want that file converted.  
	It also displays the current values of INLIB, INVOL, OUTLIB, 
	and OUTVOL and allows you to change them.


	ACUCOBOL example:

		$ wisp -q -I../copylib sample		Creates sample.wdc
		$ wisp -VACU sample.wdc			Creates sample.cob
		$ ccbl -da4 -o SAMPLE sample.cob
		$ wrun SAMPLE

	VAX/VMS example:

		$ WISP/INLIB=COPYLIB/DATACONV SAMPLE
		$ WISP SAMPLE.WDC
		$ COBOL/ANSI/FIPS=74 SAMPLE
		$ LINK SAMPLE,WISPLIB/LIB,SYS$INPUT:/OPT
			SYS$SHARE:VAXCRTL.EXE/SHARE
			^z
		$ RUN SAMPLE


	NOTE:	When you use the /DATACONV "-q" option all the copybooks
		are included into the ".wdc" file so you also need to
		use the /INLIB "-I" option.


	***         ***
	*** WARNING ***
	***         ***

	Running WISP on SAMPLE.WDC will create a SAMPLE.COB
	just as running WISP on SAMPLE.WCB creates SAMPLE.COB.
	To avoid confusion as to what is SAMPLE.COB it is
	recommended that after creating SAMPLE.WDC you move 
	it to a different "data conversion" directory.

		$ wisp -q sample
		$ mv sample.wdc ../dataconv
		$ cd ../dataconv
		$ wisp sample.wdc
		$ ccbl -da4 -o SAMPLE sample.cob

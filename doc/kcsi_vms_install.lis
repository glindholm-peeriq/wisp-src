			Installation Instructions
		 for Installing KCSI Utilities on VAX/VMS

	The following instructions assume you have a TK50 as your media type.
	Consult your system manager if the media is not TK50.

	Log onto the system account, mount the distribution kit and enter:

		$ SET DEFAULT temp_dir
		$ MOUNT/FOR/NOSHARE MU:
		$ BACKUP/VERIFY/REWIND/LOG MU:KCSIKI.BCK *.*
		$ DISMOUNT/UNLOAD MU:

	This will put the distribution files into a temporary directory.  The
	first step is to see if the executables will run:

		$ RUN CONTROL

	If no problem then copy all executables to WISP$ROOT:[EXE]:

		$ COPY *.EXE WISP$ROOT:[EXE]
		$ SET FILE/PROT=(S:RWED,O:RWE,G:RWE,W:RE) WISP$ROOT:[EXE]

	If there is a problem then you will have to re-link the executables
	on your system.  The distribution should contain a .COM for each
	utility:  

		$ @CTRLINK <RETURN> 
		$ @DTELINK <RETURN>
		$ @INQLINK <RETURN>
		$ @RPTLINK <RETURN>

	The above procedures will create the executables.  Copy the .EXEs to
	WISP$ROOT:[EXE]. (defined above)

	Copy the command file which defines foreign commands.

		$ COPY KCSI_SYMBOLS.COM WISP$ROOT:[COM]
		$ SET FILE/PROT=(S:RWED,O:RWE,G;RWE,W:RE) WISP$ROOT:[COM]*.COM

	For improved performance, each .EXE can be installed by adding the
	following to SYSTARTUP.COM
                                                                                                      
		$ RUN SYS$SYSTEM:INSTALL
		WISP$ROOT:[EXE]CONTROL.EXE/HEADER/OPEN/SHARED

		(Execute the above for each executable.)

	To define the various commands as foreign commands, edit the system
	wide login file, which is named SYLOGIN.COM and is found in the
	directory SYS$MANAGER, to contain the following line:

		$ @WISP$ROOT:[COM]KCSI_SYMBOLS

	Each user must logoff and log back in for the utilities to work.

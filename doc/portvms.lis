	WISP PORTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR VAX/VMS
	=====================================

	This document describes the actions needed to port WISP to a
	VAX/VMS platform.


	NEEDED COMPONENTS
	=================

	The following components are required to port WISP.

	[ ]	SCS directories.


	SETUP FOR WISP SOURCE KIT
	=========================

	[ ]	CREATE THE WISP DIRECTORY

		Make a base WISP directory to hold the WISP shipping kits.
		(If a WISP directory already exists don't recreate.)

		Example:
			$ CREATE/DIR SHIPPING$DISK:[SHIPPING.WISP]

	[ ]	CLEANUP THE OLD SHIP KIT DIRECTORY

		If a previous port of WISP exists on this machine then
		compress and delete the old ship kit directory.  You will
		probably need PRIVS to delete the directories.

		$ SET DEF SHIPPING$DISK:[SHIPPING.WISP]
		$ BACKUP/LOG/VERIFY [.WISP_KIT_V31...]*.* -
			[.SAVE]V31_KIT.BCK/SAVE
		$ COMPRESS [.SAVE]V31_KIT.BCK [.SAVE]V31_KIT.CMP
		$ DELETE [.SAVE]V31_KIT.BCK;
		$ DELETE [.WISP_KIT_V31...]*.*;
		$ DELETE WISP_KIT_V31.DIR;

		Do the same thing for the EDE directory.

		$ BACKUP/LOG/VERIFY [.WISP_EDE_KIT_V31...]*.* -
			[.SAVE]V31_EDE_KIT.BCK/SAVE
		$ COMPRESS [.SAVE]V31_EDE_KIT.BCK [.SAVE]V31_EDE_KIT.CMP
		$ DELETE [.SAVE]V31_EDE_KIT.BCK;
		$ DELETE [.WISP_EDE_KIT_V31...]*.*;
		$ DELETE WISP_EDE_KIT_V31.DIR;


	GENERATE THE WISP SHIP KIT
	==========================

	Build a ship kit under the "shipping" directory that will
	be used for testing WISP and when done will become the real
	ship kit.   The DCL procedure "GENKIT_FILES.COM" will generate
	all the components from SCS into:
	SHIPPING$DISK:[SHIPPING.WISP.WISP_KIT_V32].



	[ ] 	$ SCS INIT WISP VMS MASTER_ONLY
		$ SCS BUILD
			...
		Enter the name of the directory to build WISP kit in: V32
			...

	On any error you will have to fix the problem and re-issue the
	above command.


	BUILD ALL WISP COMPONENTS AND INSTALL WISP (QA)
	===============================================

	Change to the kit directory and invoke the build/install DCL
	procedure that will build and install all the components.  This
	however does not build SAMPLE.

	[ ]	DEFINE WISP LOGICALS

		Define the logicals WISP$ROOT and WISP$CONFIG.

				*** IMPORTANT *** 

		You will need the logicals WISP$ROOT and WISP$CONFIG defined
		for the whole porting process.  Always ensure that thay are
		defined correctly.

		$ DEFINE/TRANS=CONCEAL WISP$ROOT USER$DISK:[WISPQA.]
		$ DEFINE/TRANS=CONCEAL WISP$CONFIG USER$DISK:[WISPQA.DAT]

		We will install to the default of WISP$ROOT so as not to
		disturb others who are using the currently installed version.
		So, make sure the logical definition is different from the
		installed default.

	[ ]	$ SET DEF [.QA_WISP_KIT_V32]
		$ @UPDATE


	QA TEST WISP
	============

	Perform the QA testing of WISP through the building and running
	of the program SAMPLE.  If any errors are found and corrected
	then move the modified source files to their appropriate source
	directories and repeat the above steps starting at the BUILD step.

	[ ]	Follow "qawisp.lis" checklist to test WISP.


	UPDATED SCS WITH MODIFIED FILES
	===============================

	All modified source files need to be returned to SCS.  Keep a
	list of all files that changed.

	[ ]	UPDATE SCS

	INSTALL THE NEW WISP
	====================

	Install the new fully QA'ed version of WISP.  First rename
	the QA directory to the actual shipping directory then install
	components and write protect everything.  You will need PRIVS
	to do this.

	[ ]	$ SET DEFAULT SHIPPING$DISK:[SHIPPING.WISP]
		$ RENAME QA_WISP_KIT_V32.DIR WISP_KIT_V32.DIR
		$ RENAME QA_WISP_EDE_KIT_V32.DIR WISP_EDE_KIT_V32.DIR

		$ DEFINE/TRANS=CONCEAL WISP$ROOT DISK$MASTER:[WISP_ROOT.]
		$ SET DEF [.WISP_KIT_V32]
		$ @UPDATE

		NOTE: See WISP documentation (A-2 through A-3) for further
		      instructions if .HLP or .CLD files have been modified.

	INSTALL THE NEW EDE
	====================

	Install the new fully QA'ed version of WISP with EDE.

	[ ]	$ SET DEFAULT [-.WISP_EDE_KIT_V32]
		$ @INSTALL_EDE

	KCSI/UNIX UTILITIES INSTALLATION
	================================

	The KCSI distribution kits are named as follows with the "VVV"
	representing the version number.

	cridacu.VVV	  CONTROL,REPORT,INQUIRY,DATENTRY for ACUCOBOL.
	cridmf.VVV	  CONTROL,REPORT,INQUIRY,DATENTRY for Micro Focus.
	createacu.VVV	  CREATE for ACUCOBOL-85.
	createmf.VVV	  CREATE for Micro Focus.


	The KCSI utilities are normally distributed on tape or floppy
	diskettes.  Follow these instructions to unload the kit from
	the distribution media.

	1) Create a directory where you want to install the utilities
	   and then change directory to that location.

	    Ex.
		$ mkdir /usr/local/crid268
		$ cd /usr/local/crid268

	    Substitute your directory for "/usr/local/crid268" in the 
	    above example.

	2) Unload the distribution files from the media using the unix
	   tar command.

		$ tar -xvf /dev/rfd0

	    If your device is different then /dev/rfd0 substitute the 
	    correct value.

	3) If the above command creates a compressed distribution file
	   then that file will need to be unloaded, this step is
	   normally done for floppy disk distributions.

	    The compressed distribution file will be similar to one of
	    the following:

		cridacu268.cpio.Z	- Compressed cpio file
		cridacu268.tar.Z	- Compressed tar file

	    Use the appropriate command to unload the distribution files.

	    For a compress cpio file use:

		$ uncompress -c cridacu268.cpio.Z | cpio -icvd

	    For a compress tar file use:

		$ uncompress -c cridacu268.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

	    Substitute the actual file name for "cridacu268.tar.Z" in
	    the above examples.

	4) Finish the installation by following the Install.xxx
	   instructions in the distribution kit.

		cridacu.VVV/Install.acu
		cridmf.VVV/Install.mf
		createacu.VVV/Install.acu
		createmf.VVV/Install.mf

=================================

This document describes the step for installing and setting up WISP
for Windows (WIN32).

See Appendix A and B of the WISP manual for complete installation and
configuration information.


Overview
--------        

0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.
1) Install WISP/WIN32 on the server machine
2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  
3) Configure WISP on the server machine.
4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.
5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System
6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files
7) Configure the client machines
8) Command Prompt Properties (Windows 2000)


The Steps
---------

0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.

    If you are upgrading to a new release of WISP and you already have
    WISP installed on this machine then be sure to backup the
    WISPCONFIG directory.

1) Install WISP/WIN32 on the server machine

    a) Insert CD into drive D:
    b) Run D:\INSTALL\SETUP.EXE

    The following instructions refer the the WISP installation 
    directory as C:\WISPxxxx.  Adjust the instructions accordingly for 
    your actual installation directory.

2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  

    a) In Explorer or File Manager select C:\WISPxxxx
    b) From File menu select "Properties"
    c) From the Sharing tab, select "Share As:" Share Name: "WISP"
    d) Click OK

3) Configure WISP on the server machine.
    
    To configure WISP you will need to either run WCONFIG.exe to 
    setup the registry values or you will need to setup the equivalent
    environment variables.  See the WISP manual for information on
    configuring via environment variables. 

    To configure using WCONFIG.exe follow these instructions:

    a) Run C:\WISPxxxx\BIN\WCONFIG.exe
    b) Answer the prompts.

       "Would you like to import configuration information from a
       saved registry file?"

       Click "NO" to configure manually.

       "Enter WISP server:" "SERVER01"

       Enter the name of the server machine. It is very important that
       you enter the name of the server machine, it should be the name
       of the machine you installed WISP onto.

       If you do not enter the name correctly then the WISP network
       licensing will not work correctly.

       If you are installing a single cpu license for a machine which
       is not on a network then you should enter "(LOCAL)".

       For the remaining instructions we choose the name "SERVER01" as
       our server name.  You will have to substitute your actual
       server name.

       "Enter WISP directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp"

       This is the location of your WISP directory using UNC naming
       syntax and the Share Name of WISP.

       "Enter WISPCONFIG directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp\config"

       This is the location of your WISPCONFIG directory. You can
       choose any location but it defaults to the sample WISPCONFIG
       directory that is installed with WISP.

    c) Finish the configuration.

       Any yellow highlighted fields are warnings and should be
       corrected by selecting a different file or directory.

       "USERDIR:"

       This is the directory where users "home" directories are
       located.  It is often named "USERS" and located on the server
       machine.  If it is shared with a Share Name of "USERS" then you
       can enter it as "\\SERVER01\users".

       "TMPDIR:"

       This is the directory where temporary files will be created. It
       should be located on a local drive like "C:" instead of a
       network drive.

    d) Click the "OK" button to write the values to the registry
       and exit the program.

4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.

    a) Ensure you have a WISP license key. 
    b) Run C:\WISPxxxx\BIN\WLICENSE.EXE
    c) Write down the machine id that is reported by Wlicense.
    d) Contact NeoMedia Technical support for a Validation Code.
       (mailto:support@neom.com)
    e) Enter the Valication Code to complete the license
       installation. 

5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System

    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT 6.0, 5.2, 5.1 or 5.0 is installed.

    b) Ensure MicroSoft Visual C++ 6 or later is installed.

    c) Follow the build instructions for your version of 
       Acucobol.

       For Acucobol-GT 6.0 see:
        - C:\WISPxxxx\acu\acu60\build_wisp_acu60_rts.txt

       For Acucobol-GT 5.2 see:
        - C:\WISPxxxx\acu\acu52\wrun32wisp_acu52.mak

       For Acucobol-GT 5.1 see:
        - C:\WISPxxxx\acu\acu51\wrun32wisp_acu51.mak

       For Acucobol-GT 5.0 see:
        - C:\WISPxxxx\acu\acu50\wrun32wisp_acu50.mak


6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files

   Follow the instructions in Appendix B of the WISP manual.

   Share the Acucobol installation directory. (E.g. Share
   "C:\Acucorp\acucbl600\acugt") as "ACUDIR".  

   Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
   directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
   runtime system.

          RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\ACUDIR\BIN\WRUN32.EXE
          or
          RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\ACUDIR\BIN\WRUN32WISP.EXE

   Substitute the actual server and share name inplace of 
   "\\SERVER01\ACUDIR" in the above example.

7) Configure the client machines

   Each of the client machines on the network will need to be
   configured by running the Wconfig.exe program.

   The process can be simplified by "Exporting" the configuration to a
   text file then "Importing" the configuration on each machine.

   a) On the server run C:\WISPxxxx\BIN\WCONFIG.EXE
   b) Click on the "Export" button and enter a file name.

           \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg


   c) This will write the WISP registry entries to the file.
   d) Click "Cancel" to exit Wconfig.exe

   The following steps will need to be repeated on each client
   machine.

   e) On the client run Wconfig.exe using the "Run..." options off
      of the Start button.

           Run: \\SERVER01\WISP\bin\wconfig
           
   f) Click on the "Import" button and enter the registry file
      name you created earlier.  Use the network UNC form of the
      file name and click the "Open" button.

           \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg

   g) Click the "OK" button to exit Wconfig.


8) Command Prompt Properties (Windows 2000)

   On Windows 2000 if using WISP in console mode (without CoStar) you
   will need to set the Command Prompt Properties to disable the Edit
   Options "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode" as these interfere with
   mouse click processing.

   a) Open a Command Prompt console.

   b) Click on the Title Bar icon in the upper left corner of the 
      window and select "Properties".

   c) Uncheck the Edit Options "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode".

   d) Click "OK" then in the "Apply Properties" dialog select the 
      option to save the properties and apply to all future windows
      (do not choose the "current window only" option).

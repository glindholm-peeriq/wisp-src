WISP for Windows Quick Set-Up Steps
===================================

This document describes the step for installing and setting up WISP
for Windows (WIN32).

See Appendix A and B of the WISP manual for complete installation and
configuration information.


Overview
--------        

0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.
1) Install WISP/WIN32 on the server machine
2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  
3) Configure WISP on the server machine.
4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.
5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System
6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files
7) Configure the client machines
8) Command Prompt Properties


The Steps
---------

0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.

    If you are upgrading to a new release of WISP and you already have
    WISP installed on this machine then be sure to backup the
    WISPCONFIG directory.

1) Install WISP/WIN32 on the server machine

    a) Unzip the WISP distribution file to a location on a local
       disk on the server. 

    The following instructions refer the the WISP installation 
    directory as C:\WISPxxxx.  Adjust the instructions accordingly for 
    your actual installation directory.

2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  

    a) In Explorer or File Manager select C:\WISPxxxx
    b) From File menu select "Properties"
    c) From the Sharing tab, 
	- Click on "Advanced Sharing..."
	- Select "Share this folder"
	- Set Share Name: "WISP"
	- You may need to set "Permissions" to allow "Full Control"
    d) Click OK

3) Configure the WISP runtime environment on the server machine.
    
    You can configure WISP with either environment variables or via 
    registry keys.  It is recommended you use environment variables 
    for all new distributions.
    
    To configure with environment variables you will need to at a 
    minimum set the following:
    
	set WISPSERVER=MYSERVER
	set WISPDIR=\\MYSERVER\WISP
	set WISPCONFIG=\\MYSERVER\WISP\CONFIG
	set WISPUSERSDIR=C:\USERS
	set WISPTMPDIR=C:\TEMP

    The values shown above are only examples. See the WISP manual for complete 
    information on configuring via environment variables. 
    
    To configure WISP with registry keys run WCONFIG.exe to setup the registry 
    values.  On current Windows machines you should always run WCONFIG.exe
    as an Administrator.

    To configure using WCONFIG.exe follow these instructions:

    a) Run C:\WISPxxxx\BIN\WCONFIG.exe (Right-click and "Run as Administrator")
    b) Answer the prompts.

       "Would you like to import configuration information from a
       saved registry file?"

       Click "NO" to configure manually.

       "Enter WISP server:" "SERVER01"

       Enter the name of the server machine. It is very important that
       you enter the name of the server machine, it should be the name
       of the machine you installed WISP onto.

       If you do not enter the name correctly then the WISP network
       licensing will not work correctly.

       If you are installing a single cpu license for a machine which
       is not on a network then you should enter "(LOCAL)".

       For the remaining instructions we choose the name "SERVER01" as
       our server name.  You will have to substitute your actual
       server name.

       "Enter WISP directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp"

       This is the location of your WISP directory using UNC naming
       syntax and the Share Name of WISP.

       "Enter WISPCONFIG directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp\config"

       This is the location of your WISPCONFIG directory. You can
       choose any location but it defaults to the sample WISPCONFIG
       directory that is installed with WISP.

    c) Finish the configuration.

       Any yellow highlighted fields are warnings and should be
       corrected by selecting a different file or directory.

       "USERDIR:"

       This is the directory where users "home" directories are
       located.  It is often named "USERS" and located on the server
       machine.  If it is shared with a Share Name of "USERS" then you
       can enter it as "\\SERVER01\users".

       "TMPDIR:"

       This is the directory where temporary files will be created. It
       should be located on a local drive like "C:" instead of a
       network drive.

    d) Click the "OK" button to write the values to the registry
       and exit the program.

4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.

    a) Ensure you have a WISP license key. 
    b) Run C:\WISPxxxx\BIN\WLICENSE.EXE
    c) Write down the machine id that is reported by Wlicense.
    d) Contact WISP support for a Validation Code.
       (mailto:wisp@shellstream.com)
    e) Enter the Valication Code to complete the license
       installation. 

5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System

    Follow the build instructions for your version of 
    Acucobol.

       For Acucobol-GT 10.3 see:
        - C:\WISPxxxx\acu\acu103\build_wisp_acu103_rts.txt


6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files

   Follow the instructions in Appendix B of the WISP manual.

   Share the Acucobol installation directory. (E.g. Share
   "C:\Acucorp\acucbl1020\acugt") as "ACUDIR".  

   Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
   directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
   runtime system.

          RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\ACUDIR\BIN\WRUN32.EXE

   Substitute the actual server and share name inplace of 
   "\\SERVER01\ACUDIR" in the above example.

7) Configure the client machines

   Each of the client machines on the network will need to be
   configured by setting environment variables or by running the WCONFIG.exe 
   program to set the registry keys.
   
   See the WISP manual for complete information on configuring via environment 
   variables. 

   If using registry keys the process can be simplified by "Exporting" the 
   configuration to a text file then "Importing" the configuration on each 
   machine.

   a) On the server run C:\WISPxxxx\BIN\WCONFIG.EXE
   b) Click on the "Export" button and enter a file name.

           \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg


   c) This will write the WISP registry entries to the file.
   d) Click "Cancel" to exit Wconfig.exe

   The following steps will need to be repeated on each client
   machine.

   e) On the client run Wconfig.exe using the "Run..." options off
      of the Start button.

           Run: \\SERVER01\WISP\bin\wconfig
           
   f) Click on the "Import" button and enter the registry file
      name you created earlier.  Use the network UNC form of the
      file name and click the "Open" button.

           \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg

   g) Click the "OK" button to exit Wconfig.


8) Command Prompt Properties

   On Windows** if using WISP in console mode (without CoStar) you
   will need to set the Command Prompt Properties to disable the Edit
   Options "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode" as these interfere with
   mouse click processing.

   a) Open a Command Prompt console.

   b) Click on the Title Bar icon in the upper left corner of the 
      window and select "Properties".

   c) Uncheck the Edit Options "QuickEdit Mode" and "Insert Mode".

   d) Click "OK" then in the "Apply Properties" dialog select the 
      option to save the properties and apply to all future windows
      (do not choose the "current window only" option).

   ** This seems to only apply to some older versions of Windows.

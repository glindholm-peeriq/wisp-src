	SORTINFO
	========

	Usage:		SORTINFO( Filetype, Recsize, Sortcode )

	Description:	This routine is used before SORTCALL or SORTLINK
			to provide the additional parameters that are needed
			for the call to WISPSORT.

			If SORTCALL or SORTLINK is called without first
			calling SORTINFO then they default to INDEXED.

	Parameters:	All three parameters are required although RECSIZE
			is only used if FILETYPE is FIXED.  These parameters
			are identical to the parameters as described 
			under WISPSORT.

	Filetype	Alpha(1)	The type of file being sorted.
					I	INDEXED ('A' or 'C')
					A	ACUCOBOL VISION file
					C	CISAM indexed file
					F	FIXED length file
					N	Newline terminated file

	Recsize		Int(4)		The record size for FIXED files.

	Sortcode	Int(4)		The return code from sortseqf().
					See WISPSORT for description.



	SORTLINK
	========

	Usage		SORTLINK( Option sequence
				  Input file sequence
				  Selection sequence
				  Sort keys sequence
				  Ouput file sequence
				  Retcode )

	Description	This routine provides an interface to SORTCALL.

			On the Wang this routine provides an interface to
			the VS SORT utility with much greater functionality
			then that provided by SORTCALL.  With WISP only the
			SORTCALL functionality is provided.

	Parameters	The parameters are broken into sequences.  The 
			sequences must appear in the above order and at
			least one from each sequence must be present.

			Only the supported parameters are describe.  The use
			of any unsupported parameter will cause an error.

	*** Option sequence ***

	Function	Alpha(1)	The function requested
					S=SORT

	Sortoption	Alpha(1)	Indicates the option
					0=No special options
					3=Stable sort

	*** Input file sequence ***

	Informat	Alpha(1)	File media	[OPTIONAL]
					D=DISK

	Filecount	Int(4)		Number of input files
					1=Only one file allowed

	Infile		Alpha(8)	Input file

	Inlib		Alpha(8)	Input library

	Invol		Alpha(6)	Input volume

	*** Selection sequence ***

	Selcount	Int(4)		Number of selection criteria
					0=None allowed

	*** Sort key sequence ***

	keycount	Int(4)		Number of key fields.  The next
					four fields are repeated this many
					times. Maximum 8 keys.

	Position	Int(4)		Starting position of key field.

	Length		Int(4)		Length of key field.

	Type		Alpha(1)	Data type. See SORTCALL.

	Order		Alpha(1)	Sort order. See SORTCALL.

	*** Output file sequence ***

	Outfile		Alpha(8)	Output file

	Outlib		Alpha(8)	Output library

	Outvol		Alpha(6)	Output volume

	Outformat	Alpha(1)	File media	[OPTIONAL]
					D=DISK

	*** Return code sequence ***

	Retcode		Int(4)		The return code.  See SORTCALL.
					Additional codes:
					51	Unable to decode arguments
					52	Invalid argument count
					54	Function not supported
						(only 'S=SORT' is supported)
					56	Option not supported

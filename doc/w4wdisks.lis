	W4W DISKS
	=========
	This document discribes how to prepare W4W diskettes for a kit.

	The following kits can (currently) be prepared:

	    W4W 1.3 Release
	    W4W 1.3.4 Release (including Server version)
	    W4W 1.3.4 Update
	    O4W 1.3 Release  (W4W for Open3000)

	A "Release" kit is one that contains a license and requires a W4W
	diskette from Clearview in order to prepare.

	An "Update" kit is one that does NOT contain a license and can
	only be installed on a machine which has already been licensed.


	Location of Files
	-----------------

	The files needed to prepare the diskettes exist on the Windows-95
	machine CYCLONE on disk C: "\\CYCLONE\SHIPPING".  This disk is
	visable to all Windows PC's using Windows networking.  The folders
	that contain the files for the kits are listed below.

	    \\CYCLONE\SHIPPING\W4W_SHIP.13	- W4W 1.3 Release
	    \\CYCLONE\SHIPPING\W4W_SHIP.134	- W4W 1.3.4 Release & Update
	    \\CYCLONE\SHIPPING\O4W_SHIP.13	- O4W 1.3 Release

	Each of these folders contains a READMExxx.TXT file which gives
	instructions on how to create each of the kits.

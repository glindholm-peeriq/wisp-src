	WISP VERSION 3.0 DISTRIBUTION NOTICE
	====================================

	The enclosed media contain your WISP Version 3.0 distribution.

	The distribution contains the release notes and the IDSI print
	queue documentation.
		wisp/etc/RELNOTES	- release notes
		wisp/etc/PRINTQDOC	- IDSI Print Queue doc

	If you receive your distribution on floppy disks then you will
	need to follow these instructions to unload the WISP kit.

	- cd to where you want the wisp directory created.

	- Load the file wisp.cpio.Z from diskette using cpio. The kit
	  takes 3 floppies so cpio will require you to change floppies.
	  When cpio reaches the end of a diskette it will state 
	  that it "Can't read input" or that "The end of media was reached"
	  and ask you to type device/file to continue.  At this point
	  insert the next floppy and type /dev/rfd0 (or your floppy device).

		$ cpio -icvB </dev/rfd0

	- You will now have file "wisp.cpio.Z"

	- Uncompress the file.

		$ uncompress wisp.cpio.Z

	- You will now have file "wisp.cpio"

	- Now un-cpio the file.

		$ cpio -icvd <wisp.cpio

	- This will create the following directories:

		wisp/acu	- ACUCOBOL files
		wisp/aix	- AIX VS COBOL files
		wisp/bin	- programs
		wisp/etc	- Misc. files
		wisp/config	- Sample config plus videocap files

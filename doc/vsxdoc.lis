     supports reading of COBOL source files written by
     the Wang BACKUP utility.

OPTIONS (supported in this release)
     -f archive     Specify the archive to read from. This
                    can be a device special file or a normal
                    file.

     -i             Generate an index of the files in the 
                    archive.  Do not extract files.

EXAMPLES
     The following command lists all files on the tape 
     in /dev/rmt0:

     $ vsx -i -f /dev/rmt0

     The following command extracts all files on the tape
     in /dev/rmt0, and appends .wcb to them:

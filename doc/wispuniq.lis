	USING UNIQUE WITH WISP
	======================

	This document lists the changes which needed to use UniQue with 
        WISP converted software.



	Specify Print Queue programs in the OPTIONS file
	------------------------------------------------

	The following variables were previously used to inform WISP software
	that UniQue is being used:

		UNIQUE_PRINT - set to "ulp"
		UNIQUE_MAN   - set to "unique"

	These variables are no longer needed as of WISP V3.3x8.  In WISP
	V3.3x8 the OPTIONS file in $WISPCONFIG is used to control which
	print queue software is used when accessing print services.  The 
	following two OPTIONS are used:

		PQUNIQUE     - causes WISP to use ulp, unique programs
		PQILP        - case WISP to use ilp, ilpman programs 

	The UNIQUE_PRINT and UNIQUE_MAN variables are still available should
	you wish to use print queue software other than that specified by
	the OPTIONS file above.


	Move the configuration directory
	--------------------------------

	The IDSI Print Queue used the configuration directory
        /usr/spool/iprint.

	UniQue uses the configuration directory /usr/spool/uprint.

	You must rename the /usr/spool/iprint directory to 
        /usr/spool/uprint.

		$ mv /usr/spool/iprint /usr/spool/uprint

	Alternatively you can create a new directory /usr/spool/uprint 
        and copy all the files from /usr/spool/iprint into it.  This may 
        be required if your system does not allow renaming of directories.


	Rename the ilpdef to ulpdef
	---------------------------

	UniQue uses a file called ulpdef while the IDSI Print Queue
	used ilpdef.

	The following commands are used to rename this file.

		$ cd /usr/spool/uprint
		$ mv ilpdef ulpdef


	Modify ulpdef
	-------------

	The UniQue uses a different set of keys for its commands than
	the IDSI Print Queue.  To make UniQue behave like the older 
	software add the following line to ulpdef:

		default_mode=wang



	Copy the UniQue programs into your $PATH  
	----------------------------------------

	Make sure that the programs unique, udaemon, ushut, and ulp 
        are available for your users who need to run them.


	Adjust your print queue startup procedure
	-----------------------------------------

	If you have a procedure to automatically start the print queue
	at boot time, modify the procedure so that it runs "udaemon"
	instead of "idaemon".


	Other Configuration changes
	---------------------------

	If you have configured prtdef for network printing using 
	the ilpremote shell script,  you should modify prtdef to use 
	the new ulpremote.sh script (included with UniQue).

	Instructions for using ulpremote.sh are contained within
	the script itself.



	Licensing UniQue
	----------------

	UniQue is licensed separately from WISP.  Run the ulicense 
	program (provided with the UniQue kit) and answer the 
	questions as appropriate to install your UniQue license key.

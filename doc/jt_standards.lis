	Summary:	This document describes the IDSI standards for
			using the JOBTRACK account on SCALOS as a job
			tracking facility.

			ENTERING A JOBTRACK
			FOLLOW-UP OF A JOBTRACK


	====================================================================
	

	IDSI does not have a third part package for tracking problems,
	suggestions or enhancements.  So, to maintain some sort of control,
	the VMS MAIL utility is currently being used.


	ENTERING A JOBTRACK
	===================
	
	When entering a jobtrack, there is a front end facility that David
	Young wrote.  It is used by typing jt at the DCL prompt.

		$ jt <RETURN>

	First enter the company name of the client who is reporting the
	job/problem.  The Job Tracker will use the VAX editor and a jobtrack
	form will be available for editing.  Fill it in with as much detail
	as you can.  If you have a specific file that you want to referance,
	state where is is located AND provide a sample of the code in the
	jobtrack form.  It is possible that when the jobtrack is finally
	addressed, the file may not be on-line anymore.  Once you have
	completed the form, you need to exit the editor.  You will then be
	prompted for the title of the job.  This should be fairly
	distinguishable so the reviewers of the jobtracks don't have trouble
	telling jobs apart.  A copy of the jobtrack will be mailed to the
	jobtrack account and the user who entered it.

	Once the jobtrack has been entered, sombody will review it and assign
	it to a technical person.  To see what has been assigned to you,
	refer to your directory in the mail account of user JOBTRACK.  Refer
	to the above info. for more instructions on how to get there.

	
	FOLLOW-UP OF A JOBTRACK
	=======================

	To do maintenance on an OPEN problem, logon to SCALOS using the
	username JOBTRACK with the password JOBTRACK.

		$ SET HOST SCALOS

			Welcome to SCALOS:: © Running OpemVMS VAX V6.0
		Username:  JOBTRACK
		Password:  JOBTRACK

		$ MAIL <RETURN>

	This will put you into the jobtrack mail account. To see available
	folders: type dir/folder.  To change folders type dir and the folder
	name.

		$ dir wisplib <RETURN>

	If you have been assigned specific tasks then there should be a folder
	with your user id.

	It is each technical persons responsibility to review your folder
	in the jobtrack account on a weekly basis.  Once the task has been
	completed, you must notify the jobtrack system.  To do this, read the
	completed mail message which will set the mail pointer to the needed
	entry.  Then type forward/edit.  For the To: entry use JOBTRACK.  For
	the subject field, use the original text with [C]: appended to the
	beginning of the text.  Sometimes a job is not really a problem and
	thus is cancelled.  Append [CANCELLED]: to the beginning of the text
	in this case.

		MAIL> read #
		MAIL> forward/edit
		To:     JOBTRACK
		Subj:   [C]: <original subject text>

	The editor will be run with the jobtrack indicated.  Fill in the
	bottom portion of the jobtrack form as completely as possible.
	Indicate the date of the correspondance and give your initials, so
	if there are any questions.  Exit the editor and the edited version
	of the jobtrack mail will be mailed to JOBTRACK.  Note that the
	original jobtrack mail will still be in your folder so you must then
	delete it.

		MAIL> delete #
	Exit the jobtrack mail:

		MAIL> exit

	Once you have exited mail, then log off of SCALOS so you are not
	working in the JOBTRACK account.

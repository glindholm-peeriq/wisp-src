	CHANGES FROM 4.2.02 TO 4.2.03
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.2.02 to 
	release 4.2.03.

	The version numbers of utilities that are released with this
	version or WISP are:

	    CRID v2.92
	    CREATE v3.2

	This release contains ACUCOBOL native screens support for Windows
	NT/95.  See the document wispacn.txt in the wisp/acu directory for
	a complete description of ACUCOBOL native screens support on
	Windows NT/95.

	Support has been added for ACUCOBOL Vision 4 files.  A Vision 4
	file consists of two (or more) physical files that consists of a
	data portion and an index portion.  The main data file by default
	has no extension and the main index file has an extension of
	".vix".  The WISP routine "wfname" (used by "wfopen3") will
	generate the filename path (used in the ASSIGN TO clause) to the
	main data file without any extension.  ACUCOBOL allows Vision 4
	files to be separated so that the multiple physical files can
	exist in different directories.  If a Vision 4 file consists of
	more then the two main physical files or if the physical files do
	not exist in the same directory then the routines "RENAME",
	"SCRATCH", "FILECOPY" and the utility WCOPY will not work
	correctly.

	Support has been added for AcuServer on Windows NT using a WISP
	for Windows NT/95 client.  This allows a WISP migrated application
	running on Windows NT/95 to access files on a Windows NT server
	using AcuServer.  To relink an AcuServer client enabled runtime
	with WISP you will need a copy of ACUCOBOL-GT that is client
	enabled plus the PC/TCP libraries (available from Acucorp).  The
	command to relink a client enabled WISP runtime is:

	    C:\WISP\ACU> NMAKE /F WWRUNCBL.MAK CLIENT= RTS

	See the makefile WWRUNCBL.MAK for further information on building
	an Acuserver client enabled version of the runtime.  
	The WISP support for AcuServer on NT is the same as described in
	the WISP manual for UNIX except that files must be accessible
	using a Windows UNC name instead of NFS as used on UNIX.  As an
	example let say your volumes are located on "SERVER" in directory
	C:\VOLUMES which is shared with a share name of
	"\\SERVER\VOLUMES".  The LGMAP would have UNC style entries:

	    LGMAP:
	        VOL100 \\SERVER\VOLUMES\VOL100
	        VOL200 \\SERVER\VOLUMES\VOL200

	You would then need an RVMAP which would translate the UNC style
	file names into an AcuServer file name.

	    RVMAP: 
	        \\SERVER\VOLUMES\  @SERVER:C:\VOLUMES\

	All of the AcuServer warnings and restrictions described in the
	WISP manual also apply to the Windows NT version.  WISP does not
	add any special support for "cross-platform" use of AcuServer for
	use between Windows and UNIX. 

	The runtime OPTIONS file option MOUSENONMOD has been added.  This
	option instructs the runtime to allow you to mouse position to a
	non-modifiable position on the screen.  Normally you can only
	position into a modifiable field or a tab-stop.  This option is
	only meaningful when used with Co*STAR or on Windows NT/95.

	The record size limit for file sorting (WSORT,SORTCALL,WISPSORT)
	has been increased from 2024 bytes to 9999 bytes.

	The FORMS file on Windows NT/95 supports a new option "raw=1" that
	allows printing of a file that contains raw (fully rendered) data.
	This option is useful if your applications generate print files
	that contain printer control codes for a specific printer such as
	a postscript or PCL printer.  If this option is specified then the
	file is sent to the printer without processing using the RAW print
	driver.  If the "raw=1" options is used then all other FORMS
	options will be ignored so none should be specified.

	    Example FORMS file:

	    012 pagelength=66 pagewidth=96 cpi=12 lpi=6 landscape=0
	    017 cpi=16 lpi=8 lpp=88 pw=133 landscape=0
	    200 raw=1

	The runtime OPTIONS file option UTILSWINDOWS has been added.  The
	UTILSWINDOWS option instructs the runtime to run utilities
	(e.g. DISPLAY, VSEDIT, etc.) in separate windows.  This option is
	currently only meaningful on Windows NT/95 and will be ignored on
	other systems.

	The runtime OPTIONS file options DISPLAYUTIL option allows you to
	specify a substitute "DISPLAY" utility.  The substitute display
	utility should be either on the PATH or it should be specified as
	a fully qualified file path.  This utility must accept a single
	command line argument which is the name of the file to display.
	This utility will be used when a call "LINK" to "DISPLAY" is
	performed or when a "Display" option is selected from "Manage
	Files and Libraries".  The substitute display utility is expected
	to not issue getparms, the getparms will be issued by the runtime
	and translated into a filename before the utility is run.  On
	Windows NT/95 the Notepad utility makes a good substitute.

	    DISPLAYUTIL notepad.exe

	The WISP translator has been enhanced with support for the
	conditional code directives $ACN_CODE $ACN_ELSE and $ACN_END for
	translating to ACUCOBOL native screens using the -VACN language
	flag.

	If a file is originally opened from COBOL as a "work" file,
	meaning the file name starts with a '#' character or it is in the
	WORKLIB on WORKVOL, then it was marked as a "work" file.  The
	file, library, or volume names could later be changed so that it
	was no longer a work file.  If it was re-opened WISP was
	mistakenly thinking it was still a work file and it was adding
	it's directory path to the WLIBLIST file.  This has been
	corrected.

	A bug was introduced in 4.1.03 which could cause files to be
	incorrectly treated as "work" files and there directories added to
	the WLIBLIST.  This would result in the PF3 GETPARM not being
	displayed when the file was opened OUTPUT and already exists.

	The non-ASCII character support introduced a problem when the
	CHARMAP file was not being used.  Invalid input characters such as
	the ESC character (27) were being treated as valid character data
	and was entered into the field instead of ringing the bell.  This
	has been corrected so that characters outside the normal ASCII
	range (32-126, Space thru '~') are considered invalid unless they
	are mapped in the CHARMAP file.

	The CREATE utility does not obey the V-VERSION option in
	the ACUCOBOL A_CONFIG file.  It was always creating Vision 4
	files. It has been changed to default to creating Vision 3 files
	unless the environment variable V_VERSION=4 is set.

	A new Co*STAR for WISP attribute mapping mode has been added and
	is referred to as "Version 2" mapping mode.  The runtime OPTIONS
	file option COSTARV2 instructs the runtime to use version 2
	attribute mapping when Co*STAR for WISP is used.  The version 2
	attribute mapping perserves all of the Wang FAC atttributes
	including the UNDERLINE attribute which is not available in the
	original (version 1) attribute mapping.  With version 2 all
	"special" fields have the REVERSE attribute, protected fields are
	unchanged, and modifiable fields have the REVERSE attribute added.
	Hotspots are REVERSE+BLINK+UNDERLINE, and tabstops are
	REVERSE+BLINK.  Note that on the Wang, the BLINK attribute is
	actually BLINK+BOLD so the hotspot and tabstop attributes will not
	conflict with any Wang attributes.  If you use the COSTARV2 option
	you will also need to use a Co*STAR color scheme which is
	complatible (e.g. "w4w_v2").  You can also specify version 2
	attribute mapping by setting the environment variable W4W=2.  The
	following table shows how the Wang field attributes are mapped
	into Co*STAR attributes for both Verison 1 and 2 attribute mapping
	modes.  Use this table for customizing your color schemes.

	  Wang   		Version 1	   Version 2
	  ====			=========	   =========
	  Prot+Dim		Normal		   Normal
	  Prot+Bold		Bold		   Bold
	  Prot+Blink+Bold	Blink+Bold	   Blink+Bold
	  Prot+Line+Dim		Bold		   Line
	  Prot+Line+Bold	Bold		   Line+Bold
	  Prot+Line+Blink+Bold	Blink+Bold	   Line+Blink+Bold
	  Mod+Dim		Line		   Rev
	  Mod+Bold		Line+Bold	   Rev+Bold
	  Mod+Blink+Bold	Line+Blink+Bold	   Rev+Blink+Bold
	  Mod+Line+Dim		Line+Bold	   Rev+Line
	  Mod+Line+Bold		Line+Bold	   Rev+Line+Bold
	  Mod+Line+Blink+Bold	Line+Blink+Bold	   Rev+Line+Blink+Bold
	  (Hotspot)		Rev		   Rev+Line+Blink
	  (Tabstop)		Rev+Blink	   Rev+Blink

	NOTE: Very old versions of Co*STAR do not allow you to map each
	individual combination of attributes.  This capability is needed
	for version 2 mapping but was not available when version 1 was
	originally produced.

	EDE on Windows NT/95 uses the environment variable VIDEOHOME to
	find the directory for the calendar and notepad data files. If
	VIDEOHOME is not defined it used "C:\".

	The WISP translator by default generates code which uses automatic
	record locking mode.  It has been found that there are two cases
	where automatic record locking will release a record lock which on
	the Wang would not release the record lock.  If you do a READ WITH
	HOLD then either a READ (without hold) or a WRITE on the same file
	the record lock will be released where on the Wang the lock will
	kept.  If you have applications that do the above then you should
	consider retranslating them with WISP using the new "-M" option
	for manual record locking.

	The WISP translator has a new option "-M" for using "manual"
	record locking mode.  The WISP translator will by default use
	"automatic" record locking mode which has the problem described
	above.  If manual records locking mode is specified then the
	record locking will behave the same as on the Wang.  With manual
	record locking mode a READ (without HOLD) or a WRITE on the same
	file will not release a locked record the application previously
	aquired with a READ WITH HOLD.  The "-M" option may not be used
	with the "-S" (NODMS) option.


	CHANGES FROM 4.2.01 TO 4.2.02
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.2.01 to 
	release 4.2.02.

	This release contains the second pre-release of ACUCOBOL native
	screens support.  The WISP support for ACUCOBOL Native Screen is
	described in the document wispacn.txt in the wisp/acu directory.

	The VSX utility now has a "-v" option which will cause the VOLUME
	name to be included as the first level of the output file path.
	This is useful if the backup tape contains multiple volumes with
	duplicate library and file names.

	The WISP translator has been enhanced to better handle COBOL-85
	reserved words which were not reserved in COBOL-74.  If a COBOL-85
	reserved word is used as a data name in a data description entry
	the WISP translator will automatically add it to the list of
	reseverd words.  The WISP translator will rename the keyword with
	a prefix of "KW-" (earlier versions of WISP used "W-" which
	conflicted too often with other data names).  The reserved words
	CLASS, DEFAULT, OTHER, SCREEN, WAIT, and TAB were removed from the
	internal default list.

	The makefile for the ACUCOBOL runtime system on UNIX, wruncbl.umf,
	now also copies the ACUCOBOL license file (runcbl.alc) to match
	the new runtime system (e.g. wruncbl.alc).  See the ACUCOBOL
	installation instruction for further information on the ALC files. 

	The WISP translator was not recognizing qualified key names which
	used the keyword "IN" instead of "OF".

	The special hook for Co*STAR customization "W4WPOSTWRITE" was not
	being activated following a "screen pop" which occurs when
	returning from the HELP screen and from a GETPARM screen. This has
	been corrected.

	A new special hook for Co*STAR customization "W4WSCREENNAME" has
	been added.  When this environment variable is set the api string
	will be transmitted before the DISPLAY and READ logic is
	preformed.  The program name and the screen name separated by a
	colon will be appended to the api string, the control character
	(127) will be added to beginning and end of the string.

	   <127><api string><program name>:<screen name><127>

	The DATENTRY program, part of the CRID utilities, was not
	correctly handling non-updateable fields that had occurs values.
	This has been corrected in version 2.92 of CRID.

	If the last statement in a COBOL program was a COPY statement and
	copybook files was being generated (-C or -1 option) then the WISP
	translator was generating it's ending logic into the copybook
	file.  This has been corrected.


	CHANGES FROM 4.2.00 TO 4.2.01
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.2.00 to 
	release 4.2.01.

	The WISP translator has been enhanced to recognize full Wang VS
	COBOL 85 syntax as defined in the Wang VS COBOL 85 Reference
	manual.  Earlier versions did not fully handle scope delimited
	statements like END-IF, END-READ etc. and did not handle "NOT"
	clauses like NOT INVALID KEY and NOT AT END etc.  Certain
	statements are still not supported (e.g. HOLD LIST, BEGIN
	TRANSACTION, etc.) but proper warning messages are displayed.

	Earlier versions of the WISP translator when generating .lib
	copybook files (-C or -1 options) would occasionally mis-place
	statements into following (wrong) file, this would usually only
	happen when consecutive COPY statements were used.  This has been
	corrected.

	The WISP translator has been enhanced to better handle complex
	READ statements.  Previously complex READ statements where split
	into multiple components and portions of the logic was relocated
	into a separate paragraph which was then PERFORM'ed.  The READ
	logic has been simplified and is now all performed in-line.

	The WISP translator now attempts to resolve file organization and
	access mode conflicts automatically.  A SEQUENTIAL file with a
	RELATIVE KEY is changed to have an organization of RELATIVE.  A
	SEQUENTIAL file without a RELATIVE KEY will be changed to have
	SEQUENTIAL access mode.  Although WISP makes these changes
	automatically it is highly recommended the original source code be
	changed to ensure it is correct.

	The WISP translator now correctly handles MERGE statements and
	SORT statements with multiple input and output files.  

	The WISP translator now correctly handles EVALUATE statements.

	The WPROC utility had several problems relating to global
	variables not being found and local variable with the same name as
	global variables causing aborts.  These have all been corrected in
	WPROC version 1.09.  See wproc.lis for additional details.

	The WPROC utility was corrupting arguments on RUN statement that
	passed more the 18 arguments.

	The WISP translator now correctly handles READ's of the
	workstation then include the AT END or INVALID KEY clauses.

	The keyword DAY-OF-WEEK was removed from the default reserved
	words file.  If your applications use DAY-OF-WEEK as a data name
	you will need to add it to your words file.

	The WISP translator was failing to correct the UFB argument in a
	CALL "SCREEN" statement, this has been corrected.


	CHANGES FROM 4.1.03 TO 4.2.00
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.1.03 to 
	release 4.2.00.

	Acucobol has just released version ACUCOBOL-GT 3.2. This release
	contains a new indexed file system "Vision 4" which is radically
	different from their earlier indexed file system "Vision 3".  Any
	customer that upgrades to ACUCOBOL-GT 3.2 (or later) will need to
	set the Acucobol configuration entry "V-VERSION 3" to instruct the
	Acucobol runtime to use Vision 3 files as the default file type.
	The WISP runtime does not yet support Vision 4 files so vssubs
	like READFDR, RENAME, SORTCALL, and utilities WCOPY and WSORT may
	not work correctly.  See appendix F of the Acucobol-GT 3.2 manual
	for information on changes, and section 6.1.3 of the User's Guide
	for information on Vision 4 files.  WISP support for Vision 4
	files is planned for the next release.

	The WISP toolkit is now fully Year 2000 compliant. See the
	document titled "WISP Toolkit Year 2000 Compliance" for a complete
	description. 

	WISP support for non-ASCII characters has been enhanced with a new
	configuration file CHARMAP that provides character set
	translation.  A full description of CHARMAP and non-ASCII
	character support is available in the document etc/nonascii.txt as
	part of the WISP distribution kit. 

	The WISP for NT/95 release now includes the WDIAG utility.

	The Windows NT/95 network licensing was failing with an "Invalid
	License" message if the name of the server was less then 6
	characters long.

	The runtime OPTIONS file option EXTDISPLAY has been added to
	enable external LINKs to the DISPLAY utility.  The default is
	still to treat all LINKs to DISPLAY as calls to the internal
	DISPLAY routine.

	    EXTDISPLAY

	The WISP runtime can be instructed to use only pfkeys (1) to (12)
	for internally generated screens instead of the 32 pfkeys that
	were used on the Wang VS.  When the PFKEYS12 option file option is
	used then internal screens like OPEN GETPARMS use only pfkeys (1)
	to (12) and they use pfkey (12) as the EXIT key instead of the
	Wang VS standard of pfkey (16).

	    PFKEYS12

	(The PFKEYS12 option does not currently effect CRID, CREATE, or
	VSEDIT.) 

	The runtime OPTIONS file option DISPLAY8BIT has been added to
	replace the WISP_DISPLAY_8BIT environment variable.  This option
	instructs the DISPLAY utility to display 8-bit characters. The
	environment variable WISP_DISPLAY_8BIT (or registry entry on
	Windows) will override the OPTIONS file entry.

	    DISPLAY8BIT
	
	The NT/95 version of WFNAME was adding a ".DAT" extension to newly
	created data files.  This has been changed to match the WISP
	documentation and not add an extension.

	The WISP for NT/95 utility WISPTRAN.EXE had a number of problems
	which would cause it to crash, these have been corrected.

	The command processor now has a screen that displays the full
	(0-127) screen character set mapping. Press PF28 from the main
	command processor screen (or PF9 from the Extras screen).  This
	screen is useful for verifing non-ascii character mapping.

	On HP-UX 10.20 with Micro Focus COBOL 4.0 the standard CURSES
	library (-lcurses) does not work correctly.  You need to use a
	COSE compliant library, either the Color CURSES library
	(-lcur_colr) or the HCURSES library (-lHcurses).  Be sure to check
	your wrunmf.umf makefile to be ensure you are using a correct
	library.

	The VSX documentation in the WISP Version 4.0 manual contains an
	error.  The "-bs <size>" option allows you to specify the block
	size for the tape.  The size is in bytes and the maximum allowed
	value is 102400 which is also the default value.

	The following are additions to the WPROC section of the WISP
	manual under "Current Limitations". 

	    The MESSAGE statement requires at least one message-line.

	    The string concatenation operator "!!" requires string
	    constant operands be in quotes.

	It has been discovered that Micro Focus COBOL's fhconvert utility
	does not correctly convert Indexed 3 (I3) files that are
	compressed into Sequential (S0) files.  The file sort routines
	SORTCALL, WISPSORT, and the WSORT utility rely on fhconvert and
	hence do not work with I3 compressed files.  It is recommended
	that until fhconvert is corrected you do not use compression with
	I3 files.


	CHANGES FROM 4.1.02 TO 4.1.03
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.1.02 to 
	release 4.1.03.

	This release contains a pre-release version of ACUCOBOL native
	screens support.  It is described in the document wispacn.txt in
	the wisp/acu directory.

	The DATE2 vssub has been enhance with two new functions HG and HJ
	which return the current date in modified Gregorian (YYYYMMDD) and
	in modified Julian (YYYYDDD) formats.  This functions can be used
	instead of ACCEPT FROM DATE and ACCEPT FROM DAY which are not
	Year2000 compliant.

	    CALL "DATE2" USING "HG", YYYYMMDD.
	    CALL "DATE2" USING "HJ", YYYYDDD.

	The READFDR vssub has ben enhanced for YEAR2000 compliance. The
	fields CD and MD will continue to return the year-of-century in
	the format YYMMDD.  Your applications can safely assume that years
	greater then or equal to 50 use a century 1900 and years less then
	50 use century 2000. Thus YY represents the years 1950 thru 2049.
	Two new fields have been added CX and MX which are the same as CD
	and CM but return a 4 digit year in the format YYYYMMDD.

	    CX   Alpha(8)   The creation date in YYYYMMDD format.
	    MX	 Alpha(8)   The modification date in YYYYMMDD format.

	The WISP translator now issues the following YEAR2000 warnings:

	   Features of "DATE" are not YEAR2000 compliant
	   Features of "DAY" are not YEAR2000 compliant
	   Features of "READFDR" are not YEAR2000 compliant
	   ACCEPT FROM DATE is not YEAR2000 compliant
	   ACCEPT FROM DAY is not YEAR2000 compliant

	Calls to "DATE" and "DAY" should be changed into calls to "DATE2"
	which supports 4 digit years and is fully YEAR2000 compliant.

	The ACCEPT FROM DATE4 statement is translated for ACUCOBOL into
	ACCEPT FROM CENTURY-DATE.  For Micro Focus COBOL an error message
	is issued.

	Re-opening a work file was failing if the value of the WORKVOL had
	changed since the file was created.  This has been corrected.

	The VSX utility has been enhanced to now fully recognize all the
	different Wang file types.  It still can only correctly process
	CONSEC files but now it does not try to unload PROG and REL files.
	The report generated now looks much closer to the VS BACKUP
	report.

	The WPROC demo file ed.wpr is no longer included in the WISP
	shipping fit.  It can be generated by compiling ed.wps using the
	command "wproc -c ed.wps".


	CHANGES FROM 4.1.01 TO 4.1.02
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.1.01 to 
	release 4.1.02.

	NT/95: The WISP interface to the Argent Queue Manager (AQM) batch
	queue management software package has been enhanced.  There was a
	number of problems in the first release, these have been corrected
	and enhanced.  The configuration files and options have also
	changed significantly.  The corrected configuration and usage
	instructions are in the document "aqmwisp.txt", please see this
	document for further information.

	UNIX: Update routines to recognize I3 and I4 indexed files for
	Micro Focus COBOL version 3.2.  The routines effected are
	SORTCALL, SORTLINK, WISPSORT, READFDR, and utiltiy WSORT.

	The Micro Focus version of the C.R.I.D. and CREATE utilities have
	been enhanced to use the Micro Focus External file handler.  This
	enables them to access all the Micro Focus supported file types
	including I4 and I3.  This functionality is available in CRID
	version 2.90, CREATE version 3.0 (and later).

	The WISP Command Processor now has "(12) SUBMIT procedure" option
	which issues a SUBMIT, and "(8) Display Error Log" which displays
	the WISP error log file.

	The runtime OPTIONS file option IDSIPRINTOFF has been replace by a
	new option PQLP to indicate that printing will be done using the
	LP command.  The option IDSIPRINTOFF and IDSIPRINTON are still
	valid but they will be removed in future releases.

	The GETPARM vssub has been enhanced to support a Keyword field
	Data_type of "B" which uses the BLANK display attribute (Hex 98)
	for use in non-display fields like a password field.

	NT/95: The LINK vssub was not properly closing process handles
	when they were no longer needed.  Many calls to LINK would cause
	many handles to be left open which could cause a process to
	use excess system resources.  This has been corrected.

	EXTRACT vssub now supports "JN" (JOBNAME) for Unix and NT/95.

	EXTRACT vssub now supports "S$" (SYSTEM NAME) which returns the
	computers name.

	Special hooks have been added to the Wang workstation emulation
	routines to support Co*STAR for WISP customization.  These hooks
	allow Co*STAR api's to be issued before and after each individual
	read and write of the workstation.  To enable one of the hooks you
	set an environment variable equal to the api string you want
	transmitted at that point.  The api strings will have the control
	characters (127) added to the beginning and end of each string.
	Some operations like a "DISPLAY AND READ" from COBOL perform both
	a WRITE and a READ of the workstation.
	The four environment variables are:

	    Environment Variable   API Transmitted
	    --------------------   ---------------	    
	    W4WPREWRITE		   Before a WRITE to the workstation
	    W4WPOSTWRITE	   After a workstation WRITE completes
	    W4WPREREAD		   Before a READ of the workstation
	    W4WPOSTREAD		   After a worstation READ completes

	A aid to debugging videocap function key problems has been added.
	You can now instruct the WISP runtime to dump the metakey tables
	to file "vcapdump.txt" by setting the environment varible
	"VCAPMETADUMP" and then running your programs or wshell.  The file
	vcapdump.txt can then be used to debug how escape sequences are
	mapped to function keys.


	CHANGES FROM 4.1.00 TO 4.1.01
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.1.00 to 
	release 4.1.01.

	WISP for NT/95 console I/O (non-Co*STAR) support for videocap
	keymaping has been improved to allow greater flexability.
	Non-Ascii keys (function keys and special keys) now return true
	scan-codes prefixed by the special lead character ("\X") and
	optional "state" characters.  The state characters represent the
	SHIFT, CONTROL, and ALT keys in the following order.

	       SHIFT    =  "\052"
	       CONTROL  =  "\035"
	       ALT      =  "\070"

	   Examples:

	       F1	     = "\X\073"
	       Shift+F1	     = "\X\052\073"
	       Shift+Ctrl+F1 = "\X\052\035\073"
	       Ctrl+Alt+F1   = "\X\035\070\073"

	A new WINCON videocap file contains function key mapping for these
	new scan-codes.  The Escape key is now treated as a scan-code
	("\X\001") so it can be mapped to the Help key.  The new WINCON
	videocap file adds the following key mappings:

	       HELP         =  Escape Key
	       Clear Field  =  Control + Up Arrow
	       Clear After  =  Control + Right Arrow
	       Backtab      =  Control + Tab

	UNIX: The WPUTPARM utility was incorrectly incrementing the
	link-level of PUTPARMS that it created.  This was causing the
	PUTPARMS to be deleted at the wrong "unlink". This has been
	corrected. 


	CHANGES FROM 4.0.00 TO 4.1.00
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 4.0.00 to 
	release 4.1.00.

	WISP for NT/95 now has support for Co*STAR 32 for WISP using
	"Console Program" mode.  See the "Co*STAR for WISP" documentation
	for further information.

	The C.R.I.D. utilities for ACUCOBOL now support the Acu4GL
	interface for database access.

	WISP for NT/95 now allows customization of colors through the
	VCOLORS environment variable.  See the document ETC\VCOLORS.TXT in
	your WISP distribution kit for additional information.

	WISP for NT/95 default videocap keymapping has changed to not
	allow the escape key to be used as the "Help" key.  The escape key
	was conflicting with the Co*STAR function key mapping.  By making
	this change the same videocap file (WINCON) can be used with and
	without Co*STAR.

	When using Co*STAR or WISP for NT/95, mouse positioning would
	occasionally fail and write the mouse-click position information
	into a screen field.  This problem was introduced in version
	4.0.00 and has been corrected.

	On terminals where the BLINK display attribute is being simulated
	by colors (i.e. Co*STAR, WISP for NT/95, and some PC terminal
	emulators), the SPACE character was having the BLINK attribute
	removed.  This was causing the blink text to be displayed with the
	"blink color" but the spaces between the words to be displayed
	without the "blink color".  This has been corrected.

	If using Co*STAR (W4W=1) a submitted job that performed a call to
	the "LINK" VSSUB would sometimes abort due to invalid terminal
	I/O.  The background jobs were incorrectly attempting to
	communicate with the Co*STAR terminal emulator.  This has been
	corrected. 


	CHANGES FROM 3.3.19 TO 4.0.00
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 3.3.19 to 
	release 4.0.

	The WISP toolkit has been ported to Windows NT/95 for Acucobol-GT.
	This is a WIN32 port and it supports Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51
	(Intel) and Windows NT 4 (Intel). 

	The WISP for Windows product has been renamed to Co*STAR for WISP.

	The WISP Procedure Interpreter WPROC is now included as a standard
	part of the WISP toolkit.

	The WUSAGE utility has been split into the two utilities WUSAGE
	and WSHELL.  The new utility WSHELL is the WISP Command Processor,
	this previously was accessed with the "wusage shell" command.  The
	WUSAGE utility now only contains the Usage Constants maintainance
	functions. You can still run "wusage shell" to have WUSAGE spawn a
	process to run WSHELL, this is provided for backwards
	compatibility but it is better to run WSHELL directly. The old
	shell script wshell.sh is no longer available.

	Type-ahead was not working correctly on AIX 4.1 To correct the
	problem we switched to using posix style terminal control
	routines.

	Added a debugging environment variable VBUFFERING=OFF which when
	set will turn off the video buffering.  This can be used to
	correct certain types of drawing errors caused by optimization. 

	EDE: Correct certain line drawing errors which could under certain
	circumstances corrupt the screen.

	Acucobol: The wruncbl.umf makefile has been enhanced to support
	Acucobol-GT version 3.1 without requiring manual modifications.
	This makefile now has an "include" of the file "acucobol.include"
	which contains Acucobol version information.  This file may need
	to be modified if you are using a different version of Acucobol.

	A cobol STOP verb is now translated into a call to WSTOP which
	issues a Wang VS style STOP GETPARM.

	The new year 2000 compliant DATE2 vssub has been added to the
	runtime. 

	NT/95: A new wispsub WTITLE has been added which allows a COBOL
	program to change the title of the window. On UNIX this routine
	has no effect.

	A new wispsub WISPPLAT has been added which will return which
	platform it is currently running on.  This allows you to write
	conditional code based on which platform the software is running
	on (eg Windows NT vs UNIX).  A new COBOL copybook WISPPLAT.WCB is
	included in the WISP toolkit which will assist you in using the
	WISPPLAT subroutine.

	Two new wispsubs USESOFTLINK and USEHARDLINK control how the LINK
	vssub behaves.  When soft links are enabled (and available) a LINK
	vssub from one COBOL program to another COBOL program will be
	implemented as an internal call within the same RTS and will not
	spawn a new RTS.  Soft links are much faster and much more
	efficient then a hard link which spawns a new RTS, however there
	are some programming consideration when using soft links.
	Currently soft links are only available on Windows NT/95, on other
	systems these routines have no effect.

	Two new options USESOFTLINK and USEHARDLINK have been added to the
	OPTIONS file to control the default link type.

	The WISPDEBUG=FULL tracing facility has been greatly improved. The
	trace log now provides much more useful information.

	EDE: A facilite has been added to edeoldoc.c which allows you to
	add a custom menu selection to the standard menu bar.  

	EDE: The PUSHSCREEN routine was causing a Signal 11 on 64-bit
	machines (eg. DEC Alpha).

	CRID: On occasion the "add footer" logic was causing a crash.

	CRID: All of the on screen pfkey tags have been standardized so
	they work correctly with Co*STAR for WISP and with Windows NT/95. 

	CRID: The INQUIRY program can now save the query as a Wang style
	procedure which can be run with the WPROC procedure interpreter.
	The default on UNIX is to generate a shell script, to force a
	procedure to be generated set the environment variable
	KCSIGENWPROC=YES.  On Windows NT/95 the default is to generate a
	procedure.

	CRID: The maximum number of fields has been increased from 300 to
	500 fields.

	The EXTRACT vssub now supports "G#" on all platforms.

	The file extensions ".cbx" and ".acu" are now recognized as
	Acucobol object files.

	Fixed the vssub GETPARM so it doesn't crash when Message_Text is
	greater then 80 characters.

	Fixed a bug on some systems where pressing the help-key from
	within the command processor (help) screen was causing a crash. 

	Fixed an error in the processing of monkey-bar menus which was
	causing portions of the screen to be erased.

	Fixed a bug when working with Co*STAR (WISP for Windows), hidden
	fields were incorrectly being displayed.

	The DISPLAY verb now generates a Wang VS style DISPLAY getparm.

	WISP processing of DECLARATIVES now generates a call to wfilechk2
	which supports long extended file status codes.  This is
	especially useful when using Acu4GL for retrieving the full
	database error code.  Extended file status codes can now be up to
	10 characters long (previous limit was 4).

	The WSORT utility and the SORTLINK vssub was failing if 8 sort
	keys were specified and the STABLE sort option was used.

	The WISP Command Processor (WSHELL or HELP screen) now contains
	several hidden screen which display debugging and configuration
	information.  The pfkeys needed to access these screen are not
	displayed. 

	    PF32   - Copyright, platform, and version information
	    PF31   - Internal information
	    PF30   - Usage constants
	    PF29   - Environment variables

	The WISP translator previously removed or modified CALL statements
	to special routines in an attempt handle them automatically.  This
	was causing more problems then it was solving so WISP now issues a
	warning message which contains a recommended action and leaves the
	CALL statements unchanged.  The special routines affected are
	@WSOPEN, @WSCLOSE, @WSTIME, @MSTIME, @MSVALUE, and @MSTIME.

	The WISP translator was aborting with a "twiddle" error when it
	encountered a source line that contained a mod-code greater then
	11 characters long.

	The WISP translator was not correctly translating an empty
	DISPLAY-WS record.

	The WRUN utility now correctly recognizes the "-K kkk" flag as an
	Acucobol runtime flag.

	The WRUN utility now displays more useful information when run
	without a program name.

	The wac.sh script which is used with VSEDIT had problems when
	compiling with Micro Focus COBOL for debug. It was incorrectly
	moving the .cob file so that it could not be listed.

	WPROC would sometimes abort or crash on exit in the following
	situation: Program COBOL-A would run proc-B that runs proc-C with
	parameters.  When proc-C exits there would be a memory overwrite
	which would sometimes cause WPROC to crash or would sometimes
	cause proc-B to abort or experience misc. errors.

	WPROC: The MESSAGE verb was incorrectly attempting screen I/O when
	in background and this was causing it to abort.

	WPROC: The RUN command was incorrectly always setting the
	CANCEL-EXIT flag.

	WPROC was aborting when the mouse was clicked on the screen when
	used with Co*STAR for WISP (WISP for Windows).

	WPROC: The maximum number of parameters to a submitted procedure
	has been increased from 8 to 32.  The 8 parameter limit was due to
	the earlier mechanism used for submitting with parameters.

	WPROC: If a procedure is submitted with REQUEUE then don't DESTROY
	the temp proc as it will be needed again.



	CHANGES FROM 3.3.18 TO 3.3.19
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 3.3.18 to release
	3.3.19.

	- WISP has been enhanced to support AcuServer.  AcuServer is an
	  add-on product available from Acucobol which gives your COBOL
	  applications network file access without the performance
	  degradation which can occur when using NFS.  
	  See version 4 of the WISP manual for complete details.

	- ACUCOBOL: The makefile wruncbl.umf has been enhanced to support
	  the new distribution files in ACUCOBOL-85 version 2.3.3 and
	  version 2.4.  The documentation in wruncbl.umf has also been
	  enhanced. 

	- A new configuration file RVMAP (Remote Volume MAP) has been
	  added to the $WISPCONFIG directory to add support for remote
	  volumes (i.e. AcuServer from Acucobol and FileShare from Micro
	  Focus.)
	  See version 4 of the WISP manual for complete details.

	- The DISPLAY utility can now be instructed to display 8-bit
	  "foreign" characters by setting the environment variable
	  WISP_DISPLAY_8BIT=YES.

	- The NetronCap long screens would incorrectly scroll if the
	  message line was set to greater the 24.

	- UNIX: The mechanisam used to process RETURN-CODE was generating
	  a lot of unneeded stat() calls.

	- UNIX: A GETPARM would sometimes fail with a SIGNAL 10 if it was
	  satisfied by a PUTPARM that was generated from WPROC and
	  contained multiple backwards references to individual keywords.

	- UNIX: The WSORT utility now uses the same signal handler that
	  the runtime uses.

	- Logic has been added to detect and report unexpected EOF in
	  WORKING-STORAGE DIVISION.  Previously WISP would hang.


	CHANGES FROM 3.3.17 TO 3.3.18
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 3.3.17 to release
	3.3.18.

	- UNIX: Errors that occurred while printing with UniQue were being
	  reported as ILP errors.

	- UNIX: The SUBMIT vssub was failing if the total length of the
	  generated shell command was greater the 255 bytes, this would
	  normally only occur if the SETSUBMIT wispsub was used.

	- The WSFNM subroutine would fail with a Signal 11 on some
	  platforms when displaying a long screen and you pressed enter to
	  go to scroll to the next screen.

	- The VSEDIT utility has been enhanced automatically handle
	  missing line numbers without having to renumber the entire file.

	- The VSEDIT utility would loose changes made when in MODIFY mode
	  and you pressed (2) or (15).

	- The VSEDIT utility would incorrectly reset the start and end
	  line numbers after each COPY command.

	- A CALL with greater the 500 arguments would fail with an
	  internal limit exceeded.

	- The SET FAC OF XXX statement would not be correctly translated
	  if the tokens FAC OF occured on a separate line then the XXX.



	CHANGES FROM 3.3.16 TO 3.3.17
	=============================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 3.3.16 to release
	3.3.17.

	- This release contains support for the initial release of
	  "WISP for Windows".  WISP for Windows is a supplimental product
	  which runs on Microsoft Windows 3.1 and provides a graphical
	  frontend to your WISP converted programs running on UNIX or VMS.
	  WISP for Windows provides a MS-Windows look and feel which includes
	  sunken data well entry fields, raised button function key hotspots,
	  mouse enabled, optional function key icons, and customizable 
	  button bars.  You can connect your PC's to your application server
	  using TCP/IP, or most other standard PC networks, or with serial
	  data lines.

	- A new videocap function key GENERIC_MOUSE has been added which
	  defines a mouse escape sequence prefix.

	- The vt220 videocap file has been enhanced to recognize the
	  alternate arrow escape sequences.

	- The bldmf utility was not correctly handling the special
	  characters '@', '#', and '$' in un-quoted file names in COPY
	  statements.

	- WISP was not correctly handling the special characters '@', '#',
	  and '$' in un-quoted file names in COPY statements.



	CHANGES FROM 3.3c TO 3.3.16
	===========================
	The following items describe corrections and improvements that
	have been made to the WISP toolkit from release 3.3c to release
	3.3.16.

	- The WISP support for Acu4GL has been enhanced to include runtime
	  identification of database files and support for ORACLE.

	- The WSORT utility has been given a new user interface which more
	  closely emulates the Wang SORT look and behavior including better
	  detection and correction of error conditions.  The VMS version
	  has also been enhanced to support SELECT and multiple input files
	  using the underlying VMS SORT services.

	- UNIX: The IDSI Print Queue (now call UniQue) has been logically 
	  separated from the WISP library and runtime.  It will continue
	  to behave the same, however there are no version dependencies
	  so updates to WISP and UniQue can be made independently.  A new
	  release of the print queue can be installed without having to
	  rebuild your runtime system.

	- UNIX: The OPTIONS file option for selecting which print queue
	  to use now defaults to PQUNIQUE to select UniQue.  If you are
	  still using ILP you will need to set the PQILP option.

	- EDE: Older versions of the EDE library are not compatible with 
	  this version of the WISP library, you must also upgrade your EDE 
	  to the latest version.  If you attempt to build an executable
	  using an older EDE library and this WISP library you get 
	  unresolved symbols.

	- WPUTPARM utility was incorrectly shifting all values to uppercase.
	  This was making it impossible to pass a lowercase string into
	  a GETPARM.  If your scripts were relying on WPUTPARM to shift
	  these values to uppercase they will need to be corrected.

	- UNIX: The old menu-ing package described in Chapter 9 of the WISP
	  manual is no longer supported.  The routines are still available
	  in the WISP object libraries but the makefiles to build the COBOL
	  runtime systems no longer pull in these routines.

	- The WSORT utility now reports errors when unsupported options are
	  requested, it does this by issuing a respecify GETPARM and forcing
	  unsupported options to be respecified.  In previous version, 
	  unsupported options were just ignored without warning.

	- UNIX: The videocap routines now first read the Terminfo database
	  before they load the videocap files.  This allows you to create a
	  videocap file that consists of only the custom keyboard mapping
	  and options you require.

	  The videocap routines can be instructed to not read the terminfo
	  database by setting the environment variable $VNOTERMINFO.  This
	  option is provided in case there is a conflict between the
	  terminfo definitions and the videocap definitions.

		$ VNOTERMINFO=1 export VNOTERMINFO

	- The EXTRACT vssub now supports the keyword "W$" and returns
	  the value it finds in the environment variable "WISPNETID".

		'W$'	Alpha(8) 	Return the value of environment 
					variable WISPNETID.

	- UNIX: The LINK vssub now reports an error if the ACULINK or MFLINK
	  file is not found. It will also set the return code to 80.

	- The LINK vssub now supports linking to other vssubs.  The vssubs
	  that can be linked to are:

		BELL, BITPACK, BITUNPK, DATE, DAY, EXTRACT, FIND, HEXPACK,
		HEXUNPK, LOGOFF, MESSAGE, PAUSE, PRINT, READFDR, READVTOC,
		RENAME, SCRATCH, SCREEN, SEARCH, SET, STRING, WSXIO

	  Add OPTIONS file option LINKVECTOROFF to disable the linkvector()
	  routines which vector calls "LINK"s to VSSUBS into direct calls.
	
	- ACUCOBOL: Native file paths with leading '@' are now recognized as
	  being AcuServer file names, this causes the WISP name resolution 
	  logic to bypass the access checking and go directly to the
	  COBOL OPEN statement.

	- The VSX utility on SOLARIS now supports the option -3480 for the
	  3480 tape drive.

	- The WSORT utility has been given a new user interface which more
	  closely resembles the Wang utility.  It also now accepts all the
	  hidden getparms and reports errors when options have been selected
	  which are not supported.

	- The VSEDIT utility has been rewritten with extension changes.
	  See the Version 4 of the WISP manual for full details.

	- The VSEDIT utility now defaults the LANGUAGE based on the file
	  extension when given a native filepath on the command line.

	- The hidden (HELP)->(32) screen now displays platform information.

	- UNIX: Added support for printing with NP the HP/UX Network
	  Printing facility. This option is activated by including the
	  option "PQNP" in the OPTIONS file.

	- UNIX: The interaction between video and the COBOL debuggers has
	  be improved to give better screen sharing.

	- UNIX: Signal handling has been improved to avoid conflicts between
	  WISP and COBOL signal handlers.

	- UNIX: The video routines were not correctly handling padding on
	  certain terminals, notably IBM3151, which caused cursor positioning
	  to be incorrect.

	- UNIX: Certain error conditions on the tty such as a modem 
	  disconnect or other loss of connection could cause low-level
	  error reporting routines to recursively call their selves. 
	  This resulted in an orphaned process that would consume CPU
	  and stack space.  This condition has been corrected.

	- UNIX: Support for Acu4GL has been enhanced to provide runtime 
	  checking for database files with the "-4" option.  Support for
	  ORACLE has also been added.  
	  See version 4 of the WISP manual for complete details.

	- UNIX: The wruncbl.umf makefile for building the ACUCOBOL runtime
	  now contains instructions for building the Acu4GL runtime for
	  ORACLE and INFORMIX.  See the file wruncbl.umf for details.

	- UNIX: New options for the OPTIONS file.

		PQUNIQUE	- Use UniQue print queue (default)
		PQILP		- Use ILP print queue
		PQNP		- Use HP/UX Network Printing facility
		BATCHQUEUE	- The batch queue submit utility
		BATCHMAN	- The batch queue manager utility
	  	LINKVECTOROFF	- Turn off internal LINK vectoring

	- An OPEN SHARED on a SEQUENTIAL file was causing subsequent
	  OPEN SHARED statements to behave like OPEN EXTEND.

	- WISP now correctly handles an OPEN of a PRINTER file when a blank 
	  FILENAME was specified via a PUTPARM.  Previously an invalid file 
	  name was sometimes generated and an extra GETPARM was issued.

	- UNIX: On occasion when you went from the Command Processor to the 
	  shell the terminal was left in an unusable state.

	- Returning from a "(11) Enter COMMANDS" off the command processor
	  would sometimes result in a corrupted screen or a video error
	  message.

	- UNIX: Function "NA" (User Name) of the EXTRACT vssub now blank pads
	  the name to 24 characters.

	- UNIX: The MESSAGE vssub has been rewritten to provide the following
	  functionality:

		automatic port deletion, 
		proper interaction with workstation I/O, 
		check with no wait ,
		KEEP
		binary port names
		better return codes

	- The SEARCH vssub now works with binary data.

	- The SCRATCH vssub now ensure that a FILE, LIBRARY, and VOLUME
	  name were passed to it before it attempts to perform the scratch.

	- The GETPARM vssub, when it receives a value from a PUTPARM into an
	  uppercase field will shift the value to uppercase.

	- The GETPARM vssub now correctly supports the Spec_type="U".

	- UNIX: The LINK vssub now better handles the return-code when 
	  linking to shell scripts and native unix utilities.  It will set 
	  the return-code to the exit-code for these processes.

	- Changed numeric FAC handling to allow commas to support the
	  DECIMAL IS COMMA clause.

	- The READVTOC vssub was sometimes failing when called from Micro 
	  Focus COBOL because of an incorrect argument count.

	- The READVTOC vssub was failing on little-endian machines when 
	  the "Start" parameter was not equal to zero.

	- The FXZONE wispsub now recognizes 0xC0 thru 0xC9 as positive
	  zoned numeric values.

	- When not in "AUTO TAB" mode the cursor will now step out of the
	  field after the last character in the field is filled.

	- The RENAME vssub was incorrectly reporting RC=52 when the
	  when the new and old filename where the same.

	- The VSX utility sometimes failed on DG/UX with a 9-track tape
	  drive.

	- UNIX: The WDIAG utility has been enhanced to better detect and
	  report problems.

	- ACUCOBOL: The makefile wruncbl.umf has been greatly enhanced to 
	  provide a much easier facility for creating runtime systems.
	  See the documentation at the beginning of "wruncbl.umf" for
	  a complete description.

	- Micro Focus: The makefile wrunmf.umf has been greatly enhanced to 
	  provide a much easier facility for creating runtime systems.
	  See the documentation at the beginning of "wrunmf.umf" for
	  a complete description.

	- The WISP runtime error reporting system (werrlog) has been 
	  changed to use the Wang screen emulation routines (vwang).

	- The FILECOPY wispsub was sometimes not checking if the file
	  already exists and setting the return code to 52 if it does.

	- WISP utilities (WSORT, WCOPY, etc) were ignoring the OPTIONS
	  file option ERRFLAG and the environment variable WISPDEBUG.

	- Putparms with duplicate labels at the same linklevel were not
	  being erased.  This was causing backwards references to a
	  labeled putparm to always pickup the very first putparm with
	  that label at that linklevel.

	- The STRING vssub EBCDIC to ASCII translation was failing on
	  SCO unix (and others that defaulted to signed characters.)

	- The DISPLAY utility would not properly update the row and
	  column position following a search.

	- The LGMAP logic would fail if it contained blank lines and
	  comments.

	- The NetronCap screen emulation routines would sometimes get
	  a segmentation violation when used without EDE.

	- AIX: Manage SYSTEM from the Command Processor now runs
	  smit with the "-C" options.

	- The VSX utility versions 1.65 - 1.77 which were distributed with
	  WISP versions 3.3.13 - 3.3.15 fail on Little-Endian machines
	  on COMPRESSED files.  Little-Endian machines are SCO, Ultrix, 
	  Sequent, any Intel based computers.

	- The VSX utility now performs extension error checking and 
	  reporting. Previous version may have failed without reporting an 
	  error.

	- The logic which loads the videocap files would abort if it found
	  a unrecognized keyword, it has been changed to report an error
	  and continue.

	- Function key tags on WISP screens, such as the Command Processor
	  screens, have all been standardized to use the "(xx)" format.

		PF1, <PF01>, PF-1		-----> (1)
		PF16, <PF16>, PF-16             -----> (16)
		RETURN, ENTER, <RETURN> <ENTER> -----> (ENTER)

	- The declarative error detection logic now recognizes file status 96
	  as a valid Wang file status.

	- The IDNUMERIC option on BSD machines would sometimes cause a
	  signal 11.

	- The WSORT and WCOPY utility would under some conditions delete 
	  labeled putparms making backwards reference fail.

	- Add support for FAC OF XXX [IS] [NOT] ALTERED construct where
	  the [IS] and [NOT] are both optional.

	- Add support for hex and non-numeric literals that use a single
	  quote as well as a double quote.

	- WISP now handles a maximum of 250 files and 200 DISPLAY-WS screens
	  in a single COBOL program.

	- Micro Focus: Add the IGNORE LOCK clause for READ (without HOLD)
	  statements for indexed and relative files.  This is a feature of
	  Micro Focus 3.0 so WISP will no longer work with pre 3.0 versions 
	  of Micro Focus COBOL.

	- When WISP needed to expand a token and the expanded token no
	  longer fit on the line, WISP would on occasion shift the token
	  to start in column 8.

	- WISP would sometime confuse a data element that began with "CL" 
	  as being a "CLOSE" verb.

	- On systems where STOP RUN is getting changed into EXIT PROGRAM,
	  WISP now adds a real STOP RUN following the EXIT PROGRAM in case 
	  the EXIT PROGRAM falls thru.

	- Added two new directives to force OPEN I-O statements to be 
	  exclusive (not allow readers).  This is only meaningful with VMS 
	  COBOL	and ACUCOBOL which default to ALLOWING READERS.

		$OPENIOEXCLUSIVEFILE	This directive is placed before
					the SELECT for the file.

		$OPENIOEXCLUSIVEALL	Applies to all files.


	- UNIX: Add copy library prefix path option (-Pprefixpath) 
	  which specifies a list of directories of where to find copy 
	  libraries.

	  This option changes the way WISP processes COPY statements which
	  include the "IN library" clause.  If the "IN library" clause is
	  not used then this option has no effect.

	  The prefix path (-P) option allows you to specify a path which
	  is to be searched for copy library/file combination.  This is 
	  different then the (-I) option which is only used when the 
	  "IN library" clause is not specified.

	  The prefixpath is a list of one or more directories separated by 
	  colons (:) for UNIX and semicolons (;) for MSDOS.

	  Example:

		$ wisp -P/home/testlib:/disk1/qalib:/disk1/mastlib sample

	  If sample contains a copy statement of the form:

		COPY FDPAYNOW IN ACCTCOPY.

	  WISP will look in order until it finds one of the following:

		/home/testlib/acctcopy/fdpaynow.wcb
		/disk1/qalib/acctcopy/fdpaynow.wcb
		/disk1/mastlib/acctcopy/fdpaynow.wcb

	  In CONVERT mode wisp will generate the following for the above.

		COPY "acctcopy/fdpaynow.cob"

	- When translating a MOVE WITH CONVERSION that was nested in an IF
	  statement WISP was on occasion generating an unterminated IF 
	  statement.

	- The -S (/NODMS) option now causes the FREE ALL statement to be
	  translated to a PERFORM WISP-FREE-ALL.

	- DISPLAY AND READ statement with an ON PFKEY clause, where no
	  pfkeys were specified, was not working.

	- DISPLAY AND READ statement will now translate most statements
	  within the ON PFKEY and NO-MOD clauses.

	- If DISPLAY AND READ ALTERED is specified then RANGE clauses are 
	  only checked if the field was altered, otherwise all non-protected 
	  fields are checked.

	- The ALLOWING clause on a READ statement was sometimes overflowing
	  past column 72.

	- WISP now defaults to include comments and blank lines in the
	  generated COBOL. 

	- The keywords TRUE and FALSE have been removed from the internal
	  reserved words list.

	- WISP was not correctly handling the "SET condition TO TRUE" 
	  statement when condition was qualified.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------
	The following table shows the WISP release history.  Many of these
	represent internal patch releases which were never distributed or
	only distributed on very limited basis.  The "x" versions numbers
	(3.3x1, 3.3x2 etc.) were originally intended for internal use only,
	however this proved unworkable so it has been replaced with a 
	three part version number.

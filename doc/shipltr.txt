		WISP Installation Notes for VAX/VMS 
		===================================

	WISP version 3.2 contains a number of changes and improvements
	over earlier versions of WISP.  These changes are described in the
	release notes which are included as the file  RELNOTES.LIS  in the
	distribution kit.  Please print the release notes and read them 
	before using this release.

	To install the WISP kit onto your system follow the instructions
	in the WISP manual Appendix A and as amended below.

	The PROCTRAN Command Language Definition (PROCTRAN.CLD) has changed
	with this release. Make sure that you add these new definitions to 
	your DCL tables.  See Appendix A for detailed instructions.
	
		Amendments to Installation Instructions
		=======================================

	The WISP installation instructions have been amended to allow for
	greater flexablity of where on the system WISP is installed.  In
	previous releases of WISP you were required to install WISP on
	the SYS$SYSDEVICE: device.  This presented problems if you had
	space restrictions, a VAX cluster, or you wished to have multiple
	releases of WISP installed on your system.
	
	The location of the installed WISP is now completely and only
	dependent on the value of the  WISP$ROOT  logical.  To install
	WISP onto device MY$DEVICE: define WISP$ROOT as follows then run
	the UPDATE.COM procedure.

		$ DEFINE/SYSTEM/TRANS=CONCEAL WISP$ROOT -
			MY$DEVICE:[WISP_ROOT.]
		$ @UPDATE

	The definition for WISP$ROOT has been removed from WISP_INIT.COM.
	You will need to add it to your system startup file immediately
	before running WISP_INIT.COM.  Also change the command that runs
	WISP_INIT.COM to use WISP$ROOT.

		(SYSSTARTUP_V5.COM)

		$ DEFINE/SYSTEM/TRANS=CONCEAL WISP$ROOT -
			MY$DEVICE:[WISP_ROOT.]
		$ @WISP$ROOT:[COM]WISP_INIT

	Any reference in Appendix A to SYS$SYSDEVICE should now be replaced 
	by WISP$ROOT.  The UPDATE.COM procedure uses WISP$ROOT as its target
	directory.

		EDE Installation Notes for VAX/VMS
		==================================

	If you have ordered an EDE kit, there will be a second saveset 
	included on the distribution media.  Use the BACKUP command to 
	load it onto your system:

		$ BACKUP/VERIFY/LOG MU:EDEKIT.BCK *.*

	Included in the EDE saveset is a file called INSTALL_EDE.COM which 
	will do the installation of EDE.

		NOTE:  This will overwrite the WISPLIB.OLB from the
		       standard WISP kit.

		WISP Installation Notes for UNIX 
		================================

	WISP version 3.2 contains a number of changes and improvements over
	earlier versions of WISP.  These changes are described in the release
	notes which are in the distribution kit in file	wisp/etc/RELNOTES.  
	Please print the release notes and read them before using this 
	release.  The IDSI PRINT QUEUE documentation is also included in the
	kit in file  wisp/etc/PRINTQ.DOC.

	To install the WISP kit onto your system follow the instructions

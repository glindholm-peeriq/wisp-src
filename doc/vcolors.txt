	====================================================================

	This document describes how to customize WISP screen colors on
	Windows NT/95 using the environment variable VCOLORS.


	COLOR ATTRIBUTES TABLE: (VCOLORS)
	=================================

	There is an internal video table which determines how 
	display characteristics are mapped to colors. To change the 
	default values you can set the environment variable called 
	VCOLORS to a replacement hex string.  This string contains 
	32 hex characters which represent the 16 supported display 
	attributes in this order:

		0	Normal
		1	Bold
		2	Underscore
		3	Bold + Underscore
		4	Blink
		5	Blink + Bold
		6	Blink + Underscore
		7	Blink + Underscore + Bold
		8	Reverse
		9	Reverse + Bold
		A	Reverse + Underscore
		B	Reverse + Underscore + Bold
		C	Reverse + Blink
		D	Reverse + Blink + Bold
		E	Reverse + Blink + Underscore
		F	Reverse + Blink + Underscore + Bold

	There is also 16 possible colors represented by the hex digits 0-F
	in the following table.

		0	BLACK		8	GRAY (dark gray)
		1	BLUE		9	LIGHTBLUE
		2	GREEN		A	LIGHTGREEN
		3	CYAN		B	LIGHTCYAN
		4	RED		C	LIGHTRED
		5	MAGENTA		D	LIGHTMAGENTA (pink)
		6	BROWN		E	YELLOW
		7	WHITE (gray)	F	BRIGHTWHITE (white)

	Each attribute is specified as 2 hex digits. The first hex digit
	is the background color and the second is the foreground color.

		xxxx....	Background color 0-F
		....xxxx 	Foreground color 0-F

	To change the colors you would set the environment variable
	VCOLORS in you autoexec.bat file. The default VCOLORS setting
	would be specified as: 

		SET VCOLORS=F9FCB9BCE9ECA9AC797C3F3B4F4B1F1B

	Windows console mode I/O does not support either the BLINK or the
	UNDERSCORE attribute.  These attributes must be simulated by
	colors.

	The screen is erased writing spaces with attribute 0 (Normal).

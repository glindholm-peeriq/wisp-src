	RETURN-CODE Message Queue Errors
	================================

	This document is for use with version 3.2 of WISP and earlier.
	Version 3.3 of WISP does not use message queues to pass
	return codes, so this problem does not occur.

	A number of users of WISP converted software have recieved the
	following error message:


	59002 SETRETCODE-E-QUEUE [NO more processes]


	Version 3.2 of WISP and earlier use a message queue to pass the
	return code (RETURN-CODE) between processes.  If the return code
	is never read (via wretcode) then the queue can fill up and you
	will get the [NO more processes] message.

	To prevent this from happening ensure the following is done:

		1) Run "wsysinit" every night.  This will cleanup all unread
		   messages. (See WISP manual page 10-37.)

		2) Read the return code messages by running "wretcode"
		   after returning to a main menu in your application.
		   Issue a "wretcode" before you logoff.  This should
		   be added to the scripts that are used to run your
		   applications so they are done automatically.
		   (See WISP manual page 10-28.)



	If you are doing the above and you are still consistently getting
	an error it is possible that your system has been configured with
	too small a message queue.  The system parameter MSGTQL sets the 
	number of message that you can put into all queues on the system.
	This should be configured by your system administrator to be 100
	or at least equal to the maximum number of users.

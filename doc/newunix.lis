	Setting Up User Accounts On New Computer Systems

	On every new machine, create the following groups.  A user can change
	their default group (if they are in the /etc/group file) by using the
	"newgrp" command.  All user accounts for groups 200 and 210 must have 
	umask 0006 set.  All other user accounts (groups 300 and 500), should
	initially have umask 0000 set.  It is OK for users in group 300 to
	change their umask, but group 500 should always have umask 0000.

	GID	GROUP-NAME	DESCRIPTION
	200	idsi		IDSI Engineering team (only 2xx UIDs)
	210	idsi-staff	IDSI Employees not on engineering team.
	300	foreign		Non-IDSI Employees with computer access.
	500	training	Customers of IDSI, training and support.

	Only IDSI employees should get a UID between 200 and 299 with a GID of
	200 (210 if not an engineer).  The following list should be used to 
	assign UIDs with user names.  New employees should be added to this 
	list (assign UID and LOGIN NAME).  These UIDs and LOGIN NAMES were 
	selected based on the most frequent usage on all current machines.

	UID:GID	LOGIN-NAME	USER-FULL-NAME
	200:200	idsi		Generic IDSI login

	IDSI engineers get UIDs from 201 to 219.  Other IDSI staff 251 to 299.
	Contractors get UIDs from 220 to 250 if on the IDSI engineering team.
	Customers of idsi (training and support) get GID=500, UID=5xx.
	Others (Not idsi, contractor, nor customer) get GID=300, UID=3xx.

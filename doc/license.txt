	WISP RUNTIME LICENSE TRACKING
	=============================

	This document describes the WISP Runtime license system that
	will be in place for release 3.2 of WISP.

	In this release only UNIX will be addressed.



	OVERVIEW
	========

	IDSI needed a way of tracking and limiting use of the WISP
	runtime system to only those site which are actually licensed.
	With the Wang deal and changing business climate we also needed
	to be able to sell Runtime-Only licenses that are "locked" to
	a machine serial number.  Additionally we needed to be able
	to send out "DEMO" versions of WISP that would time-out after a
	given number of days.

	To solve these issues a WISP Runtime license system has been
	created.   

	Every WISP kit will be sent out with a LICENSE KEY.  When the
	user installs WISP he will have to run the program wlicense
	which will install the WISP license on that machine.  If the
	machine is not licensed a WARNING message will be displayed
	that will tell them to run wlicense.  It will NOT prevent them
	from running.  This is important because we do not want to 
	cause users undo duress.  They will simply have to press RETURN
	to continue with their program.



	DEFINITIONS
	===========

	LICENSE KEY	A 16 digit string that contains the encoded
			customer number, platform code, license type,
			expiration date etc.

	MACHINE ID	The unique identifier for a machine.  On AIX
			and HP/UX the uname() function returns a
			"serial number".  On other machines we fake-it
			by returning the inode of the license file.

	VALIDATION CODE  A 3 digit string that "locks" the LICENSE KEY
			and MACHINE ID together.

	PLATFORM	The machine/OS combination being used.
			Eg. AIX RS/6000 is one platform, ULTRIX RISC is
			a different platform.  There is a unique 2 digit
			code for each platform.  A LICENSE KEY is tied
			to a specific platform.


	COMPONENTS
	==========

	wlicense	This is the WISP license installer program
			that will be distributed as part of the WISP kit.

	wauthorize	This is the IDSI only utility that is used
			to generate the LICENSE KEY and the VALIDATION
			CODE.

	/lib/wisp.license
			The WISP license file.  This is created by
			wlicense and contains the LICENSE KEY and
			VALIDATION CODE.



	TYPES OF LICENSES
	=================

	SINGLE		A SINGLE machine license.  A LICENSE KEY of this
			type would require a new VALIDATION CODE for every
			machine it was to run on.  This type of license
			would be issued to new users that buy only a
			SINGLE user license, or who buy a runtime only
			license.

	UNLIMITED	An UNLIMITED machine license.  This type of
			LICENSE KEY would be issued to existing customers
			who have bought an unlimited runtime license.
			It could be used on any machine of the same
			platform type.  It does not require a VALIDATION
			CODE as it is not locked to a MACHINE ID.

	TIMED		A DEMO license that will time-out on a given
			date.  This will allow the user to run for 30
			days (or as given) without any warning messages 
			then it will stop running completely.  It does
			not require a VALIDATION CODE.



	SCENARIOS
	=========

	1)  Existing customer with an UNLIMITED runtime license.

		Eg. Sending out WISP 3.2 to NISSI for the RS6000.

		We run wauthorize and generate an UNLIMITED license
		for the RS6000.  This gets sent to them with the
		WISP kit.  They will then run wlicense on their
		machine to install the license.

		NISSI can then license each of there customer sites
		by either running the wlicense program at each site
		using the same LICENSE KEY or they could simply
		copy the WISP license file /lib/wisp.license to
		each site.

		Note that they can use this key on any RS6000 because
		it is an UNLIMITED key but it will not work on an HP 
		or SUN system, only on the RS6000.


	2)  New customer that buys a SINGLE machine license.

		Eg. ABC Company buys a SINGLE machine license for HP/UX.

		We run wauthorize and generate a SINGLE machine license
		for the HP/UX machine.  This gets sent to them with
		the WISP kit.  They will then run wlicense on their
		HP machine to install the license.  The wlicense program
		will report to them a MACHINE ID and tell them to call
		IDSI to get the VALIDATION CODE.  

		When we get the call we will run wauthorize again.
		We will ask them for their LICENSE KEY and MACHINE ID
		and will generate the VALIDATION CODE.  They will enter
		the VALIDATION CODE into wlicense to complete the 
		license installation procedure.

		We will record this into a log to ensure we don't
		give out VALIDATION CODEs to users who are not licensed.


	3)  Customer wants a DEMO license for a different platform.

		Eg. SOTAS wants a DEMO copy of WISP to try out the SUN.

		We run wauthorize and generate a TIMED license that
		will expire in 30 days.  They install it as above and
		run with it for 30 days.  When it expires they will have 
		to buy a real license to continue running on that machine.

		Note that when they buy their real license all they
		will have to do is run wlicense to install it.  There
		are no code changes required to run.

	4)  Customer buys 3 runtime licenses for the Wang RISC Series.

		We run wauthorize and generate a SINGLE machine
		LICENSE KEY.  We then issue 3 VALIDATION CODES.

		Thats 1 LICENSE KEY + 3 VALIDATION CODES.  We do not
		generate 3 keys.   Again we have to log how many
		VALIDATION CODES have been issued and only issue what
		has been bought and paid for.
	
	

	WAUTHORIZE
	==========

	The wauthorize program is for use at IDSI only, it can only be
	run by a user with a group-id of "idsi".

	It has three main functions:
		1) Generate a LICENSE KEY
		2) Generate a VALIDATION CODE
		3) Test a LICENSE KEY and VALIDATION CODE

	In order to generate a LICENSE KEY you will need the following
	information:

		CUSTOMER NAME		The name of the customer. This is
					recorded in the log and written on
					the LICENSE KEY document.

		CUSTOMER NUMBER		The up to 6 digit customer number.
					This will be in the customer 
					database.

		PLATFORM		The 2 digit code for the platform.
					A table of values will be displayed.

		LICENSE TYPE		SINGLE, UNLIMITED, TIMED

		LICENSE DATE		Defaults to todays date.

		EXPIRATION DATE		Only for TIMED keys, it defaults
					to one month from today.

	In order to generate a VALIDATION CODE you will need the 
	following information:

		CUSTOMER NAME		The name of the customer.

		LICENSE KEY		The customer must tell you the
					LICENSE KEY that was issued to
					them for this platform.

		MACHINE ID		The unique machine identification.
					This is displayed to the customer
					when he runs wlicense.

	If a customer is having trouble installing his WISP license
	you can use the TEST function of wauthorize to verify that his
	LICENSE KEY or VALIDATION CODE is valid.  This function will
	decode the LICENSE KEY and display its values.

This program will generate WISP license keys and validation codes for use with
the wlicense program.  This program is for use by IDSI personnel only!


LICENSE KEY        The LICENSE KEY is the code that is sent out with every
                   WISP kit.  It defines the type of license and contains the
                   encoded CUSTOMER NUMBER, PLATFORM, LICENSE TYPE, and the
                   EXPIRATION DATE.

VALIDATION CODE    The VALIDATION CODE is the code that "locks" the LICENSE
                   KEY to the machine serial number (MACHINE ID).

At any prompt you may type a question mark for help or a period to exit.
                   ?   HELP on the prompt.
                   .   EXIT the program.

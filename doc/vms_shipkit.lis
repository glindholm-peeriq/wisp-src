	Generating WISP kits for VMS
	----------------------------

	1 - Set default to SHIPPING$DISK:[SHIPPNG.WISP]

	2 - Check the DCL file WISPKIT.COM to ensure that it is
	    going to default to the version you want to produce.

	3 - Insert a TK50 into tape drive (MKA0)
	    Note:  it is not necessary to INIT or MOUNT the tape.

	4 - For a standard WISP kit execute WISPKIT as follows:

		$ @WISPKIT MAK0:

	    For a WISP kit which includes EDE:

		$ @WISPKIT MKA0: EDE

	    The tape will automatically dismount when complete.

	5 - Include a copy of the WISP installation instructions
	    along with the tape.

	WISP PORTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR MS-DOS
	====================================

	This document describes the action needed to port WISP
	to the MS-DOS platform.


	NEEDED COMPONENTS
	=================

	The following components are required to port WISP.

	[ ]	WISP source kit  e.g.  wisp33.tar

	[ ] 	COBOL compiler  (ACUCOBOL 386 extended)


	CREATE THE WISP SOURCE KIT
	==========================

	Construct kit on unix as an uncompressed TAR format.  Use a
	dos style 8.3 filename e.g. WISP33.TAR

		unix:	## The first part may have already been done.
			## Don't repeat if not needed.

			$ bldscrkit.sh			On hammer build src kit
			> Path: /usr2/gsl
			> Dir:  src33

			$ cd /usr2/gsl/src33
			$ tar -cvf wisp33.tar src	Create TAR file


	INSTALL THE COBOL
	=================

	If COBOL is not already on the system then install it.

	[ ]	Install ACUCOBOL.


	LOAD THE WISP SOURCE KIT
	========================

	[ ]	CREATE THE WISP DIRECTORY

		Make a base WISP directory to hold all the WISP related
		files. (If a WISP directory already exists don't recreate.)

		Example:
			> E:
			E:> cd \
			E:> mkdir WISP33

	[ ]	SET ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

		Set the variable WISP equal to the WISP directory.
		Set ACUDIR to the ACUCOBOL directory.

				*** IMPORTANT *** 
		You will need the variable WISP set for the whole porting 
		process.  Alway ensure that it is set correctly.

			$ SET WISP=E:\WISP33
			$ SET ACUDIR=C:\ACUCOBOL

	[ ]	LOAD THE NEW SOURCE KIT

	 	Load the source kit. FTP it from hammer then untar it.

			E:> cd \WISP33
			E:> ftp hammer			Ftp to hammer
			ftp> bin			Use binary transfer
			ftp> /usr2/gsl/src33
			ftp> get wisp33.tar		Get src TAR file
			ftp> bye
			E:> pctar -xvqf wisp33.tar	Untar the file

	[ ]	FLIP ALL THE .BAT FILES

		All the .BAT files need the NL changed to CRLN, this is
		done with a program called FLIP.

			E:> cd \WISP33\SRC
			E:> flip -m *\*.bat


	BUILD ALL WISP COMPONENTS
	=========================

	Change to the port directory and start the super-make that will
	start all the makefiles to build all the components.  This however
	does not build SAMPLE.

	[ ]	$ cd C:\WISP33\src\port
		$ copy makewisp.wat makefile
		$ nmake

	On any error you will have to fix the problem and re-issue the
	above nmake command.


	BUILD THE WISP SHIP KIT
	=======================

	Build a temporary ship kit under the "src" directory that will
	be used for testing WISP and when done will become the real
	ship kit.   The script "bldshipkit.sh" will move all the
	components from the built source kit into "%WISP%\src\ship" and
	it will build the correct directory structure.

	[ ] 	$ cd C:\WISP33\src\port
		$ bldship.bat


	QA TEST WISP
	============

	Perform the QA testing of WISP through the building and running
	of the program SAMPLE.  If any errors are found and corrected
	then move the modified source files to their appropriate source
	directories and repeat the above steps starting at the BUILD step.

	[ ]	Follow "qawisp.lis" checklist to test WISP.


	UPDATED SCS WITH MODIFIED FILES
	===============================

	All modified source files need to be returned to SCS.  Keep a
	list of all files that changed.

	[ ]	UPDATE SCS

	CREATE THE REAL WISP SHIP KIT
	=============================

	Create the real WISP SHIP KIT from the QA version.  Substitute the
	real version for "XXX" in the following commands.

	[ ]	Move and rename %WISP%\src\ship to %WISP%\shipXXX
		This needs to be done thru MS-WINDOWS as MS-DOS doesn't
		have commands to move or rename directories.

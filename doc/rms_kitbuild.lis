The following is a description of how to create RMS_EXPERT shipping
kits;

- Determine which format the kit needs to be built on 
  (9-track tape or TK50 tape cartridge

- Mount the tape on the appropriate device

     If mounting a TK50, make sure red button is "out" and the
     green light is on prior to removing an existing cartridge that
     might be in place.  Insert cartridge, close door and press the
     red button (never force the door).

     When mounting a 9-track tape, insert the tape, close the door
     and press the load and on-line buttons.

- Log on to PRIDE

- Set priviliges on with the following command:
  $ PRIVS
  If PRIVS is not set up for your account, you will get an error
  at this point.  If so, contact the System Manager.

- Set the default directory path for RMS_EXPERT:
  $ SET DEF SHIPPING$DISK:[SHIPPING.RMX]

- Begin creating the kit by entering the appropriate statement:
  $ @RMXKIT MSA0 (this statement builds the kit on 9-track tape)
  $ @RMXKIT MUA0 (this statement builds the kit on a TK50)
  
After starting the program, a series of prompts will appear. 
Answer them as follows;
  
    Are you ready (Y/N)? 

Check to see that the tape drive has started up OK.  If there are
lights blinking on the device you are using, wait a minute before
proceeding.  If all is OK, key in a "Y" and press RETURN.

    Are there already savesets on this tape (Y/N)?

Enter an "N"

    Do you wish to initialize this tape (Y/N)?

Enter a "Y"








At this point the program will begin processing and will display a
number of messages which require no response.  When complete (after
about 5 - 10 minutes), the following message will appear;

     Is there another saveset to create (Y/N)?
 
Enter a "N" 

If the kit build went OK, you'll get the following message:

     Kit Build Completed Successfully

If you don't get this message, get an engineer involved.

- Dismount the tape.  If dismounting a 9-track tape, press ON-LINE
  and the UNLOAD button, wait for the tape to unload before
  removing.  If dismounting a TK50, press the red button, wait for 
 the green light to come on, open the door and remove the   
  cartridge.

	I would first like to thank you for participating in our beta
	test program for WISP Version 3.2.  Your help is needed for IDSI
	to produce a polished product.  We appreciate any comments and 
	suggestions you care to make.

	The goal of the beta test program is to raise the quality of
	our software.  This is done by subjecting WISP to the rigors of
	field sites where problems may be detected that did not show up 
	during our normal quality assurance testing procedures. Any problems
	detected can then be corrected before the software is widely
	distributed.  This is a two week program.  If no major problems are
	reported within two weeks we will consider the beta test program
	completed.  If there are problems the program will be extented.

	If for any reason you do not wish to participate in our beta test
	program, or you can not shortly begin using the beta test WISP 
	Version 3.2, please let us know immediately.

	To install this release of WISP follow the instructions in the
	WISP manual Appendix A.  The release notes are included as a file 
	in the distribution kit:

		UNIX:	wisp/etc/RELNOTES
		VMS:	RELNOTES.LIS

	Please print them out and read them before using this release.

	If you discover any problems or have any suggestions please
	contact us immediately.

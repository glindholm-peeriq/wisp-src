	Generating WISP kits for UNIX
	-----------------------------       

	1 - Run the automated kit creation script makeshipkit on zaphod.

		$ makeshipkit

		This is prompt for media, os, kits, etc. then it will
		run tar to create the kit.

	2 - Include a copy of the WISP installation instructions
	    along with the media.


	Creating a Compressed kit
	-------------------------
	If you are creating a shipping kit on floppy you want to use
	a compressed version of the kit to save space.  These will normally
	already be available and name "KIT.tar.Z" if not available you
	can create on with the following instructions.

		$ cd /disk2/shipping/OS/wispxxx.ship
		$ tar -cvf - wisp | compress > wisp.tar.Z

	Building a SHAREABLE library:

	The end result will have WISP_SHR.EXE located in WISP$ROOT:[EXE] and
				 WISP$SHARE.OPT located in WISP$ROOT:[LIB].


	Two logicals need to be added to the system:

		WISP$SHARE points to WISP$ROOT:[LIB]WISP$SHARE.OPT
		WISPSHR    points to WISP$ROOT:[EXE]WISP_SHR.EXE

		(These have been added to WISP_INIT.COM)

	Make sure you have the DCL command procedure called WISP_SHARE.COM.

	To build a shareable library execute WISP_SHARE.COM:

			$ @WISP$ROOT:[COM]WISP_SHARE

	Note that you will need about 25,000 blocks of scratch space to
	build the shareable image.  Make sure WISP_SHR.EXE is located in 
	WISP$ROOT:[EXE].  Install the image WISP_SHR.EXE as OPEN/HEADER/SHARE.

	Create the WISP$SHARE.OPT file with the following information included:

			WISPSHR/SHARE
			SYS$SHARE:VAXCRTL.EXE/SHARE
			psect_attr=WISPFILEXT		,NOSHR
			psect_attr=WISPRETURNCODE	,NOSHR

	Make sure WISP$SHARE.OPT is located in WISP$ROOT:[LIB].


	To link your application to the shareable library use WISP$SHARE.OPT:

			$ LINK/EXE=TEST.EXE TEST.OBJ,WISP$SHARE/OPT

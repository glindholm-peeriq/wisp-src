Some educated questions to ask when evaluating the feasibility of a 
conversion project.

	GENERAL:

	1. How knowledgeable is the customer about their systems, programs
	   and data structures?

	2. How big is the system?
	   a. Total number of COBOL programs, and total lines of COBOL 
	      code (NOTE: include copy books/libraries)?
	   b. Total number of Wang Procedures, and total lines of 
	      Procedure code?
	   c. Total number of data files, and total size of files in megabytes?
	
	3. Any other program code types, ASSEMBLER, BASIC, PASCAL, RPG, FORTRAN?

	4. Diagram the VS VOLUME structure and LIBRARY structure used
           (by name) and the equivalent structure on the target machine.

	5. Are there going to be enough IDSI resources and customer resources
	   to complete the project?

	   a. What is the target machine (system)?
	   b. What type (if any) vendor support is available?




	COBOL PROGRAMS:

	1. System and program documentation?

	2. How extensively are the following statements used?

	   a. HOLD LIST
	   b. HOLDER-ID ON READ/WRITE WITH TIMEOUT
	   c. CANCEL-EXIT  (On VMS in connection with the LINK VSSUB)
	   d. WRITE WITH TIMEOUT
	   e. READ X INTO WS-RECORD-FOR-X  (on held records with Micro Focus)

	3. Are there any main-logic section statements which refer to
	   paragraphs in the DECLARATIVES section? (and vice-versa.)

	   b. Is there I/O in DECLARATIVES paragraphs?

	4. How much do you rely on Wang file status codes (74 or 85)?

	5. How many and what type of VSSUBS are used? 
	
	6. Are there any third party interfaces required (ie. word 
	   processing, spread sheets. etc.)?

	7. Security features used (ie. userid tested within code, or
	   creating data files)

	   b. Use of Wang file class.

	DATA FILES:

	1.  How many data file types are there?

	2.  How many of the data files use "multiple record types"?  

	3.  Do the indexed files use:

	    a. Only keys defined with USAGE IS DISPLAY types?
	    b. Keys with leading separate signs?
	    c. Keys with trailing separate signs?
	    d. COMPUTATIONAL type key fields?
	    e. Overlapping KEYS and/or split key requirments?

	4.  How many are RELATIVE files?



	PROCEDURE LANGUAGE

	1.  System and procedure documentation?

	2.  For what purposes are the procedures being used?

	    a. Displaying menus to drive the COBOL applications?
	    b. Simply calling COBOL programs?
	    c. More involved programming tasks?

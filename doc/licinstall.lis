	Installing a WISP License Key on UNIX
	=====================================

	The WISP runtime system will now require that the system it is
	running on be licenced.  This document describes how to install a
	WISP license onto a UNIX system.

	If your system is not licensed for WISP you will get a warning
	message each time you run a WISP converted program.  The warning
	message will state that you are running on a unlicensed system.

	Included with your WISP release will be a document entitled "WISP
	Runtime License Key".  On this document is your License Key.  You
	will require this key to install a WISP license on your system.

	Installation Steps:

	INSTALL WISP

		Use the normal procedure as described in the WISP manual 
		Appendix A to install WISP on the system.

	RUN WLICENSE

		Run the program "wlicense".  You will need to be the ROOT
		user to run "wlicense".  It will request information from
		the "WISP Runtime License Key" document.  If you purchased
		a SINGLE machine license you will also require a
		validation code.  Follow the instructions given by
		"wlicense" to acquire a validation code.

	The file "/lib/wisp.license" will be created to store the license 
	information.  This file will be checked by running programs to
	verify that the system is licensed.

	If you have purchased an UNLIMITED runtime license for a given
	platform you can license additional machines of the same type by 
	repeating the above procedure on each system, or you can simply
	copy the license file "/lib/wisp.license" to each machine.

	ADDITIONAL NOTES ON THE WSORT UTILITY
	=====================================
	
	This document provides additional information on using the wsort 
	utility, it is meant to be used in conjunction with the WISP manual.
	See chapter 10 of the WISP manual for a description of WSORT, and
	chapter 5 for a description of WISPSORT.

	The wsort utility is a replacement for the Wang VS SORT utility,
	it is not an exact duplicate of SORT.  

	When wsort is used from UNIX or MS-DOS it is very important that
	you add the FILETYPE= parameter to the INPUT putparm.  This is
	used to identify what type of file is being sorted.  If you are
	sorting a sequential file with fixed length records (FILETYPE=F)
	then you MUST also supply the RECSIZE= parameter.  The RECSIZE=
	parameter tells wsort the size of each record.


	FILETYPE: The type of file to be sorted:
	----------------------------------------

	The FILETYPE= parameter tells wsort what type of file is to be
	sorted.	 This is required because under UNIX and MS-DOS there
	is no reliable way of determining this.

		I	Indexed file 
		F	Fixed length records, sequential file
		N	Newline terminated, sequential file (Text file)
	
	Earlier versions of wsort supported A=ACUCOBOL and C=CISAM, this
	has been replaced by I=INDEXED.


	PROCTRAN: Translation of RUN SORT statements:
	---------------------------------------------

	The proctran utility does not have enough information to fully
	translate the RUN SORT statements. After translation you must
	edit the COBOL and add the FILETYPE= and RECSIZE= parameters
	to the INPUT putparm.


	UNLOADING AN INDEXED FILE:
	--------------------------

	Before wsort can sort an indexed file it must be unloaded into a
	temporary sequential file.  This is done by calling a utility.
	For ACUCOBOL vision files wsort uses the vutil utility supplied by
	ACUCOBOL.  For Micro Focus ISAM files wsort uses the fhconvert
	utility supplied by Micro Focus.  For C-ISAM files wsort knows
	how to do the unload internally.

	These utilites "vutil" for ACUCOBOL and "fhconvert" for Micro Focus 
	must be on the users $PATH and the user must have execute access 
	of them.

	The temporary sequential file used is ##SORT in WORKLIB on WORKVOL.


	TEMPORARY DISK SPACE:
	---------------------

	The wsort utility requires temporary disk space to perform the
	sort.  If sorting an indexed file it requires enough space to hold 
	the temporary sequential on the WORKVOL.  It requires enough space
	to hold the output file, even if the output file is being written
	over top of the input file.  It also requires twice the file size
	in the /tmp file system (or $TMPDIR if using a different temporary
	directory.)

	Example: If sorting a 25 meg indexed file you need the following
		 free space.

		25 meg free on WORKVOL
		25 meg free on the output volume
		50 meg free on /tmp (or $TMPDIR)

	All temporary files will be deleted when wsort completes, even if
	wsort terminates because of an error.


	DEBUGGING WSORT:
	----------------

	The wsort utility normally does not display any error messages, it
	sets the exit code to indicate an error.  To have it display any
	error messages run it from the shell and give it the "-v" option.

		$ wsort -v

	This will cause it to display any error messages.

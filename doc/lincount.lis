				Using LINCOUNT on Wang VS

	Overview
	--------

	LINCOUNT is a simple utility used to count the number of COBOL
	lines in a Wang VS source library.  LINCOUNT creates a report
	on SPOOLVOL in the users #???PRT library, listing totals by
	library:

		Total COBOL lines	 Total non-COBOL lines
					 (i.e. blanks, comments, etc.)

		Total Lines of code

		Grand total for all libraries.

	Using LINCOUNT
	--------------

	1.  For MS DOS formatted diskettes:  To upload LINCOUNT to the
	    Wang VS run VSPC928 and transfer the file in VSDMS mode.  

	    - or -

	    Run LINCOUNT from the diskette or load LINCOUNT onto the
	    Wang VS using BACKUP/RESTORE.


	2.  The display screen will ask for the VOLUME and LIBRARY of
	    the COBOL source.

	3.  When the process for the current library is complete, you
	    can indicate the next library.  The results will be appended
	    to the generated report file.  Press PF16 to exit the utility.


	NOTE:

	Please be sure to include any COPY libraries that are associated
	with the programs to be migrated.

	This document contains notes regarding the use of AcuServer with
	WISP converted software. 

	NOTE:	WISP does not yet provide support for AcuServer.


	NOTES ON USING ACUSERVER WITH WISP CONVERTED SOFTWARE
	=====================================================

	There are two main issues involved in using AcuServer with WISP
	converted software.

	1)	AcuServer uses a custom syntax for fully specifing the 
		location of a file which includes a node/machine name.
		This syntax is NOT compatable with normal "C" or UNIX
		file specifications.

		Syntax:		@server-name:path-name

		Example:	@remote:/disk1/myvol/mylib/myfile

	2)	There will not be a physical file that is locally 
		accessable thru normal "C" or UNIX routines.  There are
		numerous places in the WISP environment that attempt to
		access files.  Most importantly these occur in the pre-open
		logic (wfopen) and in the VSSUBS.


	The OPEN logic must be instructed to bypass all it's normal pre-open
	checking and the VSSUBS that expect a file will not work.

		FIND
		RENAME
		SCRATCH
		READFDR
		READVTOC
		SORTCALL/WISPSORT/WSORT
		WCOPY

	AcuServer can apply to CODE and DATA files.

	Add the AcuServer server-name prefix to the LGMAP for the data 
	volumes. Keep the code/object/executables on local or NFS volumes.

	Example: $WISPCONFIG/LGMAP

		DATA01 @remote:/disk1/data01
		DATA02 @remote:/disk2/data02
		CODE01 /disk1/code01
		CODE02 /nfs/remote/disk2/code02
		TEMP   /tmp

	The wfopen() routine has been modified to check if the native file 
	path has a leading '@' character and if it does the pre-check logic
	is bypassed.

	Temporary (##) file name generation fails on AcuServer volumes.
	All temp files must be on local or NFS volumes.

	Automatic file path creation fails.  Normally the file path will
	be created automatically when the file is created.  Specifically
	the library portion of the path is normally created on the fly.
	This does not work on AcuServer files, the file path must already
	exist or the create (OPEN OUTPUT) fails.

	The Object files must be local (or NFS).  They can't reside
	on AcuServer volumes if used with LINK, SUBMIT etc.  If the AcuCOBOL
	object files are used -ONLY- thru COBOL CALL statements then
	they can be placed on AcuServer volumes.

	Open OUTPUT does not check if the file exists and does not prompt
	you to confirm deletion of the previous file before continuing.

  REQUIRED CHANGES TO EDE FOR VERSION 3.3 OF WISP
  ===============================================

  This document describes the changes needed for users of EDE.
  The changes were necessary to support the 64 bit Alpha 
  OSF/1 platform.

    *** NOTE *** 
      These changes apply to ALL users of EDE, even those
      who are not using Alpha OSF/1.

  There are two source code changes needed for users of EDE.

  1.  The menu structure has changed.  The new IDSI menu control
      block copybook is as follows:

        * International Digital Scientific Corporation
        * Extended Development Environment
        * COBOL 85 copy member to allocate menu control blocks.
  
        * Menu control block allocation.
  
         01 MAX-LEVELS PIC 9(9) BINARY VALUE 12.
         01 MENU-CONTROL-BLOCKS.
            02 MCB OCCURS 12 TIMES.
               03 MCB-MENU-TYPE     PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-OPTIONS  PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-ROW      PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-COLUMN   PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-WIDTH    PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-ITEMS    PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-ITEM     PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-BACKITEM PIC 9(9) BINARY.
               03 MCB-MENU-CODE     PIC 9(9) BINARY OCCURS 20 TIMES.
               03 MCB-MENU-TEXT     PIC X(64) OCCURS 20 TIMES.
               03 FILLER            PIC X(184).

     Note that the following members are NO LONGER PRESENT in
     the menu control block:

               MCB-MENU-SAVE
               MCB-MENU-LINK

     
  2. A parameter passed to the following routines must be
     changed:

               PUSHSCRN
               PUSHAREA
               POPAREA

     Routines PUSHSCRN and POPAREA have only one parameter,
     this parameter must be changed.  For the routine PUSHAREA, 
     only the last argument must be changed.

     The parameter has been declared in the past as follows:

         01 SAVE-AREA PIC 9(9) BINARY.

     The parameter declaration must be changed to the following:

         01 SAVE-AREA PIC X(8).

     (The size of the SAVE-AREA item must be increased to eight
     bytes.)

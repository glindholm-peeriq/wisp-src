Products:       WISP/UNIX

Summary:        How to install WISP from the distribution media.

====================================================================


The complete installation instructions are in Appendix A of
the WISP Manual.


WISP/UNIX INSTALLATION NOTES
============================

WISP is normally distributed as a compressed tar file named
"wisp_XXXX.tar.Z".

Follow these instructions to unload the WISP kit from the
distribution media.

1)  Change directory where you want to install WISP. The install
    process will create the WISP directory under the current
    working directory.

    Ex.
        $ cd /usr/local

    Substitute the desired directory for "/usr/local" in the above
    example.  In this example WISP will be installed in directory
    "/usr/local/wisp_XXXX" where "XXXX" is the WISP version number.


2)  Copy the tar.Z file ("wisp_XXXX.tar.Z") from to the
    installation directory "/usr/local".


3)  Unload the tar file with this command:

	$ uncompress -c wisp_XXXX.tar.Z | tar -xvpf -

    This will create directory /usr/local/wisp_XXXX.

    You can then delete the tar file.


4)  The directory /usr/local/wisp_XXXX will be created and the 
    following directories will have been created under
    wisp_XXXX. 

        acu        ACUCOBOL specific files
        bin        The executable programs
        config     Sample configuration files
        etc        Miscellaneous files
        lib        The link libraries
        mf         Micro Focus specific files

    The file wisp_XXXX/etc/wisp_relnotes.txt contains the release
    notes. 


5)  The WISP license will need to be installed. If you are
    upgrading from a previous release of WISP you will be able to 
    continue using the same license.  However you may need to 
    reinstall the license into a new location.

    NOTE: If you are upgrading from WISP 4.4.06 or earlier the 
    license file locations have changed, read the release notes
    for additional information.

    % /usr/local/wisp_XXXX/bin/wlicense


6)  Next you will need to build a new COBOL runtime system.

    The procedure for building a COBOL runtime is fully documented
    in the unix makefiles for each COBOL.  Please READ the
    instructions at the beginning of the makefile before
    proceeding.

    For ACUCOBOL the instructions are in acu/wruncbl.umf.

    Ex.
        $ WISPDIR=/usr/local/wisp_XXXX
        $ ACUDIR=/usr/local/acucobol
        $ export WISPDIR ACUDIR
        $ cd $WISPDIR/acu
        $ make -e -f wruncbl.umf

    For Micro Focus the instructions are in wisp/mf/wrunmf.umf.

    Ex.
        $ WISPDIR=/usr/local/wisp_XXXX
        $ export WISPDIR
        $ cd $WISPDIR/mf
        $ make -e -f wrunmf.umf


7)  Setup the UNIX runtime environment.

    See Appendix B "Setting Up The Runtime Environment" of the
    WISP manual for a complete description. 


8)  Check the environment setup by running the wdiag utility.

        $ /usr/local/wisp_XXXX/bin/wdiag

    This utility will detect and report problems with the setup.

	WISP SUPPORT FOR NP THE HP NETWORK PRINT FACILITY
	=================================================
	
	This document describes the WISP support for NP the HP/UX network
	printing facility.  WISP can now be configured to use NP for all
	its printing.
	
	NP is part of the HP/UX OpenSpool product and it is designed as a
	replacement for LP.  NP is very similar in operation to LP, except
	that the option flags are different.


	Configuring WISP to Use NP
	--------------------------
	A new option has been added to the WISP OPTIONS file to instruct 
	WISP to use NP for printing.

	Uncomment (or add) the option "PQNP" to the file $WISPCONFIG/OPTIONS.
	When the PQNP option is used WISP will use "np" instead of "lp" when
	it is building the print command.  It will also ensure that any
	options it internally adds to the "np" command are correct.

	$WISPCONFIG/OPTIONS Example:
		...
		IDSIPRINTOFF		- Turn off UNIQUE
		PQNP			- Use NP instead of LP
		...

	Configuring Printing Options
	----------------------------
	To configure the printing options for NP you use the exact same
	configuration files as with LP.  These files are used to "map"
	the Wang style print options to NP command line options.  The files
	used are, FORMS to map the form number, LPMAP to map the print
	class, and PRMAP to map the printer number.

	FORMS example:
		001 -P form1
		005 -P legal -F Times
		132 -P wide -F Courier

	LPMAP example:
		A -p high
		B -p normal
		C -p low

	PRMAP example:
		001 -q laserqueue
		002 -q salesroom
		003 -q dotmatix

	Using the above examples, if file "/home/bill/timecard" was printed
	with PRTCLASS=B, FORM_NUM=005, COPIES=2 (and PRINTER=000) the 
	following NP command would be issued:

		np -s -P legal -F Times -p normal -c 2 /home/bill/timecard
		  (1) (2)               (3)       (4) 

	(1) The "-s" option is always added to suppress screen output.
	(2) The FORMS file mapping for FORM_NUM=005
	(3) The LPMAP file mapping for PRTCLASS=B
	(4) The "-c 2" option is added because COPIES=2 was requested.

	See the WISP Manual page 7-22 for a complete description of the
	configuration files FORMS, LPMAP, and PRMAP.

	====================================================================
	
	Introduction
	------------
	The last release of WISP on VMS has a limit of 100 total job and
	print queues.  This patch allows you to change that limit.  This
	document contains instructions for installing the patch.


	Instructions for fixing the WISP 100 queues limit on VMS
	========================================================

	Load the patch source kit onto your VMS system. The patch kit
	consists of the C source file SETUPQM.C plus 13 header files. 

	Edit the file SETUPQM.C and change the MAX_TOTAL_QUEUES define
	to be the maximum number of queues (print and job queues) that
	your system needs.  It is currently set at 200, it previously was
	set at 100 in the last release of WISP on VMS.  

	Look for the following line in the file SETUPQM.C:

	    #define MAX_TOTAL_QUEUES  200

	Next you need to compile SETUPQM.C with the C compiler to
	generate the object file SETUPQM.OBJ.  Then replace this object
	file into the WISP library.  When you compile you need to use the
	/DEFINE=VMS switch.

	    CC/DEFINE=VMS SETUPQM.C
	    LIBRARY/REPLACE WISPLIB.OLB SETUPQM.OBJ

	Finally you need to re-link your executable programs using the
	version of WISPLIB you just modified.  To re-link the WISP
	executable use the UPDATE.COM script that came with WISP.  Use
	your own link scripts to re-link your programs.

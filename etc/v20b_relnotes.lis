	RELEASE NOTES FOR WISP VERSION V2.0B
	====================================

	- ACUCOBOL: Added wispsub ACUNARGS, this will return
	  the number of arguments passed across a LINK.

	- ACUCOBOL: ACULINK has been updated to call ACUNARGS and call the
	  linked to program with only the number of args passed,
	  previously ACULINK always called with 16 args.

	- VMS: Added usersub LINK return and completion codes.

	- Added TRIGGER KEY to run user defined program.

	- ACP routines for have been implemented for UNIX.

	- On UNIX if USAGE CONSTANTS were changed at a lower
	  link level they would not be reflected upon return
	  until the program was restarted. This has been corrected.

	- On UNIX, usersub LINK with a "link-type" of ' ' (blank)
	  would use the RUNLIB & RUNVOL only. It will now also check
	  in the current directory to find the program.

	- The usersub SCREEN now correctly backfills the file, library
	  and volume with the actual name used.

	- SCREEN would give an invalid vwang function of 0 (zero) when
	  printing the screen, this has been fixed.

	- WISP record lock tracking now uses the filename instead of 
	  an index number.

	- VAX MANUAL RECORD LOCKING is implemented. All WISP converted
	  programs that run on VMS now use full MANUAL RECORD LOCKING
	  for all file I/O.

	- The NOLOCK_PROCESSING switch is no longer supported in WISP.

	- The TRAP_START_TIMEOUTS option is no longer supported.

	- ACUCOBOL: The usersub LINK now allows 32 parameters (was 16).

	- ACUCOBOL: Calls to "wvaset" before variable argument usersubs
	  have been removed from the COBOL and are now done transparently
	  by the sub85() routine.

	- ACUCOBOL: comp-5 binary data type has been replaced by comp-4.
	  This is the ACUCOBOL internal byte ordered binary. On byte
	  swapped machines sub85() will now transparently change
	  comp-4 data items into native bytes order on calls to 
	  usersubs & WISP routines. This has the effect of making
	  ACUCOBOL object code transportable across all machines.

	- If there is no screen I/O then the screen will not be reset
	  on program termination.

	- ACUCOBOL: a call "LINK" to another ACUCOBOL program does
	  not force a clear of the screen. The screen is still
	  reset, just not cleared.

	- ACUCOBOL: a program returning from a call "LINK" does
	  not force a clear of the screen.

	- NEWLINE key has been added.

	- WISP would previously crash or generate uncompilable
	  code if a large number of records (01 level) were 
	  specified for a single FD (greater then approx 35 records).
	  This has been fixed.

	- When the COMP Key file option was used WISP would indent
	  the entire line (including the line number) 2 spaces, this
	  would cause uncompilable code. This has been fixed.

	- VMS: The type ahead buffer has been re-installed.

	- VMS: A "LINK" to an ".EXE" now works. (You still must
	  call "setwispfilext" first.)

	- The DISPLAY utility now displays control characters as 
	  a space.

	- VMS: The problem with WCHAIN causing a stack dump has been fixed.

	- Videocap now supports the use of nulls in key definitions.

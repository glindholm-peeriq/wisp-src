WISP for NT/9x Quick Set-Up Steps
=================================

This document describes the step for installing and setting up WISP
for Windows NT/9x.

See Appendix A and B of the WISP manual for complete installation and
configuration information.


Overview
--------        

0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.
1) Install WISP for NT/9x on the server machine
2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  
3) Run Wconfig.exe to configure the server machine.
4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.
5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System
6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files
7) Configure the client machines


The Steps
---------

0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.

    If you are upgrading to a new release of WISP and you already have
    WISP installed on this machine then be sure to backup the
    WISPCONFIG directory.

1) Install WISP for NT/9x on the server machine

    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
    b) Run A:SETUP

    The following instructions assume you have installed WISP in
    directory C:\WISP4xxx .  If you have installed WISP into a
    different location the adjust the instructions accordingly.

2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  

    a) In Explorer or File Manager select C:\WISP
    b) Windows 9x: From File menu select "Properties"
       NT 4.0:     From File menu select "Properties"
       NT 3.51:    From Disk menu select "Share As..."
    c) From the Sharing tab, select "Share As:" Share Name: "WISP"
    d) Click OK

3) Run Wconfig.exe to configure the server machine.

    a) Run C:\WISP4xxx\BIN\WCONFIG.EXE
    b) Answer the prompts.

       "Would you like to import configuration information from a
       saved registry file?"

       Click "NO" to configure manually.

       "Enter WISP server:" "SERVER01"

       Enter the name of the server machine. It is very important that
       you enter the name of the server machine, it should be the name
       of the machine you installed WISP onto.

       If you do not enter the name correctly then the WISP network
       licensing will not work correctly.

       If you are installing a single cpu license for a machine which
       is not on a network then you should enter "(LOCAL)".

       For the remaining instructions we choose the name "SERVER01" as
       our server name.  You will have to substitute your actual
       server name.

       "Enter WISP directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp"

       This is the location of your WISP directory using UNC naming
       syntax and the Share Name of WISP.

       "Enter WISPCONFIG directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp\config"

       This is the location of your WISPCONFIG directory. You can
       choose any location but it defaults to the sample WISPCONFIG
       directory that is installed with WISP.

    c) Finish the configuration.

       Any yellow highlighted fields are warnings and should be
       corrected by selecting a different file or directory.

       "USERDIR:"

       This is the directory where users "home" directories are
       located.  It is often named "USERS" and located on the server
       machine.  If it is shared with a Share Name of "USERS" then you
       can enter it as "\\SERVER01\users".

       "TEMPDIR:"

       This is the directory where temporary files will be created. It
       should be located on a local drive like "C:" instead of a
       network drive.

    d) Click the "OK" button to write the values to the registry
       and exit the program.

4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.

    a) Ensure you have a WISP license key. 
    b) Run C:\WISP4xxxx\BIN\WLICENSE.EXE
    c) Write down the machine id that is reported by Wlicense.
    d) Call NeoMedia Technical support for a Validation Code.
    e) Enter the Valication Code to complete the license
       installation. 

5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System

    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT V4.0 (or later) is installed and the
       Acucobol BIN directory is on the PATH.

          PATH %PATH%;C:\ACUCBL42\ACUGT\BIN

    b) Ensure MicroSoft Visual C++ 5 or 6 is installed.
    c) Edit the makefile WWRUNCBL.MAK in C:\WISP4xxx\ACU to
       change ACUDIR to the location where Acucobol was
       installed. 

           ACUDIR=C:\ACUCBL42\ACUGT

    d) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window
    e) In the MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window run the bat file
       Vcvars32.bat that came with MS Visual C++. This bat
       file enables you to compile and link C programs from
       the command prompt. 
       (Substitute path to Vcvars32.bat with the location used by
       Visual C++) 

       MSVC++ 4.x:
          C:> C:\MSDEV\BIN\VCVARS32.BAT x86

       MSVC++ 5.x:
          C:> "C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\bin\Vcvars32.bat" x86  

       MSVC++ 6.x:
          C:> "C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC98\bin\Vcvars32.bat" x86  

       NOTE: If you get an out-of-space message, click on the
             properties button on the toolbar, go to the Memory tab,
             set the Initial Environment size to 4096, click OK, close
             the MSDOS/Command window, reopen and try again.

    f) Change directory: cd C:\WISP4xxx\ACU
    g) Issue the commands to build the Runtime.

           C:> nmake /f wwruncbl.mak rts

    h) The Runtime System WWRUNCBL.EXE will have been created.

6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files

   Follow the instructions in Appendix B of the WISP manual.

7) Configure the client machines

   Each of the client machines on the network will need to be
   configured by running the Wconfig.exe program.

   The process can be simplified by "Exporting" the configuration to a
   text file then "Importing" the configuration on each machine.

   a) On the server run C:\WISP4xxx\BIN\WCONFIG.EXE
   b) Click on the "Export" button and enter a file name.

           \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg


   c) This will write the WISP registry entries to the file.
   d) Click "Cancel" to exit Wconfig.exe

   The following steps will need to be repeated on each client
   machine.

   e) On the client run Wconfig.exe using the "Run..." options off
      of the Start button.

           Run: \\SERVER01\WISP\bin\wconfig
           
   f) Click on the "Import" button and enter the registry file
      name you created earlier.  Use the network UNC form of the
      file name and click the "Open" button.

           \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg

   g) Click the "OK" button to exit Wconfig.

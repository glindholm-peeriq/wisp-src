	WISP for NT/95 Quick Set-Up Steps
	=================================
	
	This document describes the step for installing and setting up
	WISP for Windows NT/95.

	See Appendix A and B of the WISP manual for complete installation
	and configuration information.


	Overview
	--------	

	0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.
	1) Install WISP for NT/95 on the server machine
	2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  
	3) Run Wconfig.exe to configure the server machine.
	4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.
	5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System
	6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files
	7) Configure the client machines


	The Steps
	---------

	0) Backup the WISPCONFIG directory.

	    If you are upgrading to a new release of WISP and you already
	    have WISP installed on this machine then be sure to backup the
	    WISPCONFIG directory.

	1) Install WISP for NT/95 on the server machine

	    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
	    b) Run A:SETUP

	    The following instructions assume you have installed WISP in
	    directory C:\WISP .  If you have installed WISP into a
	    different location the adjust the instructions accordingly.

	2) Share the WISP directory using a Share Name of "WISP".  

	    a) In Explorer or File Manager select C:\WISP
	    b) Windows 95: From File menu select "Properties"
	       NT 4.0:     From File menu select "Properties"
	       NT 3.51:    From Disk menu select "Share As..."
	    c) From the Sharing tab, select "Share As:" Share Name: WISP
	    d) Click OK

	3) Run Wconfig.exe to configure the server machine.

	    a) Run C:\WISP\BIN\WCONFIG.EXE
	    b) Answer the prompts.

	       "Would you like to import configuration information from a
	       saved registry file?"

	       Click "NO" to configure manually.

	       "Enter WISP server:" "SERVER01"

	       Enter the name of the server machine. It is very important
	       that you enter the name of the server machine, it should be
	       the name of the machine you installed WISP onto.

	       If you do not enter the name correctly then the WISP
	       network licensing will not work correctly.

	       If you are installing a single cpu license for a machine
	       which is not on a network then you should enter "(LOCAL)".

	       For the remaining instructions we choose the name
	       "SERVER01" as our server name.  You will have to substitute
	       your actual server name.

	       "Enter WISP directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp"

	       This is the location of your WISP directory using UNC
	       naming syntax and the Share Name of WISP.

	       "Enter WISPCONFIG directory:" "\\SERVER01\wisp\config"

	       This is the location of your WISPCONFIG directory. You can
	       choose any location but it defaults to the sample
	       WISPCONFIG directory that is installed with WISP.

	    c) Finish the configuration.

	       Any yellow highlighted fields are warnings and should be
	       corrected by selecting a different file or directory.

	       "USERDIR:"

	       This is the directory where users "home" directories are
	       located.  It is often named "USERS" and located on the
	       server machine.  If it is shared with a Share Name of
	       "USERS" then you can enter it as "\\SERVER01\users".

	       "TEMPDIR:"

	       This is the directory where temporary files will be
	       created. It should be located on a local drive like "C:"
	       instead of a network drive.

	    d) Click the "OK" button to write the values to the registry
	       and exit the program.

	4) Run Wlicense to install the WISP license.

	    a) Ensure you have a WISP license key. 
	    b) Run C:\WISP\BIN\WLICENSE.EXE
	    c) Write down the machine id that is reported by Wlicense.
	    d) Call NeoMedia Technical support for a Validation Code.
	    e) Enter the Valication Code to complete the license
	       installation. 

	5) Build the Acucobol Runtime System

	    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT V3.1 is installed and the Acucobol BIN
	       directory is on the PATH.

	          PATH %PATH%;C:\ACUCBL31\BIN

	    b) Ensure MicroSoft Visual C++ 4 is installed.
	    c) Edit the makefile WWRUNCBL.MAK in C:\WISP\ACU to change
	       ACUDIR to the location where Acucobol was installed.

	           ACUDIR=C:\ACUCBL31

	    d) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window
	    e) In the MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window run the bat file
	       C:\Msdev\Bin\Vcvars32.bat. This bat file enables you to
	       compile and link C programs from the command prompt.
	       (Substitute "C:\Msdev" with the location of Visual C++)  

	           C:> C:\MSDEV\BIN\VCVARS32.BAT x86

	    f) Change directory: cd C:\WISP\ACU
	    g) Issue the commands to build the Runtime.

	           C:> nmake /f wwruncbl.mak rts

	    h) The Runtime System WWRUNCBL.EXE will have been created.

	6) Setup the WISPCONFIG files

	   Follow the instructions in Appendix B of the WISP manual.

	7) Configure the client machines

	   Each of the client machines on the network will need to be
	   configured by running the Wconfig.exe program.  

	   The process can be simplified by "Exporting" the configuration
	   to a text file then "Importing" the configuration on each
	   machine.

	   a) On the server run C:\WISP\BIN\WCONFIG.EXE
	   b) Click on the "Export" button and enter a file name.

		   \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg

	   c) This will write the WISP registry entries to the file.
	   d) Click "Cancel" to exit Wconfig.exe
	   
	   The following steps will need to be repeated on each client
	   machine. 

	   e) On the client run Wconfig.exe using the "Run..." options off
	      of the Start button.

	           Run: \\SERVER01\WISP\bin\wconfig
		   
	   f) Click on the "Import" button and enter the registry file
	      name you created earlier.  Use the network UNC form of the
	      file name and click the "Open" button.

		   \\SERVER01\WISP\wisp.reg

	   g) Click the "OK" button to exit Wconfig.

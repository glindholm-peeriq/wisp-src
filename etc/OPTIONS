# Set the error reporting level	
#ERRFLAG 15

# Turning signals off will cause a core file to be created on a
# signal 10 or 11. (UNIX only)
#SIGNALSON		(default)
#SIGNALSOFF

# A NULL (hex 00) usually displays as a space on the screen. 
# To find them set NULLISDOT and they will display as a 
# dot (.), this is useful in tracking down odd screen behavior.
#NULLISSPACE		(default)
#NULLISDOT

# If you want WISP to never prompt you on an OPEN OUTPUT to 
# "Press PF3 to Continue" then set OUTPUTVERIFYOFF.
#OUTPUTVERIFYON		(default)
#OUTPUTVERIFYOFF

# If you want WISP to automatically "create" a volume when not
# found in LGMAP then set CREATEVOLUMEON. (UNIX only)
#CREATEVOLUMEOFF	(default)
#CREATEVOLUMEON

# WISP can use either the ILP of UNIQUE versions of the Print Queue.
# To changed the default use one of the following options.
#PQLP			(Use LP)
#PQILP			(Use ILP)
#PQUNIQUE		(Use UNIQUE - default)
#PQNP			(Use NP the HP/UX network print)

# WISP can use either the UNIQUE Batch Queue, another batch queue
# product, or no batch queue product.
#
## No batch queue
#BATCHQUEUE none	(No batch queue)
#BATCHMAN none 		(No batch queue management tool)
#
## UniQue Batch Queue options
#BATCHQUEUE usubmit	(Use UniQue usubmit to submit jobs)
#BATCHMAN ubatchman 	(Use UniQue ubatchman to manage batch queue)
#
## Argent Queue Manager on Windows NT Options
#BATCHQUEUE  AQM
#BATCMAN     none

# If you want EXTRACT to return a numeric ID instead of the alpha
# default, then set IDNUMERIC.
#IDALPHA		(default)
#IDNUMERIC

# If you want EXTRACT to return the 5-7 characters instead of
# the 1-3 default, then set IDFIVE.
#IDONE			(default)
#IDFIVE

# WISP normally filters out "fatal" file status codes and causes an
# "error getparm" EVEN when the user has supplied DECLARATIVES. 
# If you specify ALLSTATUSKEYS then WISP will pass all status codes
# through to the users DECLARATIVES when present.
#ALLSTATUSKEYS

# WISP defaults to a maximum of 128 PRBs (putparms) and uses a shared
# memory size of 40 pages (page size is 512 bytes).  You can adjust
# these values to "tune" your system. (NOTE: Keep ratio approx 3:1)
#MAXPRBPARMS 128	(default 128)	
#MAXPRBPAGES 40		(default 40)

# WISP defaults to a Wang style HELP screen (HELPSYTLE1).
# HELPSTYLE2 can be used to change to a non-Wang style HELP screen.
#HELPSTYLE1		(default)
#HELPSTYLE2

# WISP will vector CALL "LINK"s to VSSUBS into internal calls of the
# desired VSSUB.  The LINKVECTOROFF option will disable this feature.
#
#LINKVECTOROFF

# WISP/NT can implement a "LINK" from one COBOL program to another
# COBOL program as an internal "call".  This is referred to as a
# "soft link" and it is much faster an much more effecient then a 
# "hard link" which involes spawning a new processes and starting
# a new COBOL RTS.  However, since the new program is being run by
# the same RTS it can result in a recursive call which will fail.
#
#USEHARDLINK		(default)
#USESOFTLINK

# If you have translated your applications for Acucobol Native Screens 
# then uncomment the NATIVESCREENS option to inform the runtime.
#
#NATIVESCREENS

# The WISP runtime can be instructed to use only pfkeys (1) to (12)
# for internally generated screens instead of the 32 pfkeys that
# were used on the Wang VS.  When the PFKEYS12 option file option is
# used then internal screens like OPEN GETPARMS use only pfkeys (1)
# to (12) and they use pfkey (12) as the EXIT key instead of the
# Wang VS standard of pfkey (16).
#
#PFKEYS12

# The EXTDISPLAY option instructs the runtime to use the 
# external DISPLAY utility instead of the internal DISPLAY 
# routine which is the default.
#
#EXTDISPLAY

# The DISPLAY8BIT option instruct the DISPLAY utility to display
# 8-bit non-ASCII characters without CHARMAP substitution. If the
# option NATIVECHARMAP is specified it will override this option.
#
#DISPLAY8BIT

# The NATIVECHARMAP option instructs the runtime and utilities that
# text data within the application is encoded using the "native" 
# character set based on CHARMAP the character map configuration 
# file.  If this option is not specified then the default behaviour
# is to encode text data using the "Wang" character set.
# When this option is set the "DISPLAY AND READ" processing (through
# the wscreen routine), the GETPARM VSSUB, and the DISPLAY and 
# VSEDIT utility will automatically convert between "native" and 
# "Wang" character set encoding and "native" character set encoding
# will be returned to the applications (or saved in the file).
#
# NOTE: The workstation operations READ, REWRITE, and WSXIO are
#       not affected by this option and will use the "Wang" 
#	character set.  Embedded FAC's can not be used with "DISPLAY
#	AND READ" screens.

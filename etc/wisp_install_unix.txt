        Summary:        How to install WISP from the distribution media.

        ====================================================================
        

        The complete installation instructions are in Appendix A of
        the WISP Manual.


        WISP/UNIX INSTALLATION NOTES
        ============================

        WISP is normally distributed on tape, CD or floppy diskettes.
        Follow these instructions to unload the WISP kit from the
        distribution media.

        1)  Change directory where you want to install WISP. The install
            process will create the WISP directory under the current
            working directory.

            Ex.
                $ cd /usr/local

            Substitute the desired directory for "/usr/local" in the above
            example.  In this example WISP will be installed in directory
            "/usr/local/wisp.XXXX" where "XXXX" is the WISP version number.


        2)  Unload the distribution files from the tape or floppies
            using the unix tar command.

                $ tar -xvf /dev/rmt0

            If your device is different then /dev/rmt0 substitute the 
            correct value.

            For CD media, mount the CD and copy the tar files to
            /usr/local. 


        3)  If the above command creates a compressed distribution file
            then that file will need to be unloaded, this step is normally
            done for floppy disk distributions.  A compressed file has an
            extension of ".Z".

            The compressed distribution file will be named:

                wisp.XXXX.tar.Z       - Compressed tar file

            Use the following command to unload the distribution files.

            For wisp.4306.tar.Z use:

                $ uncompress -c wisp.4306.tar.Z | tar -xvf -

            Or, to unload a tar file that is not compressed use:

                $ tar -xvf wisp.XXXX.tar

            You can then delete the distribution file.


        4)  The directory /usr/local/wisp.XXXX will be created and the 
            following directories will have been created under
            wisp.XXXX. 

                acu        ACUCOBOL specific files
                bin        The executable programs
                config     Sample configuration files
                etc        Miscellaneous files
                lib        The link libraries
                mf         Micro Focus specific files

            The file wisp.XXXX/etc/RELNOTES contains the release notes.


        5)  This machine will need to be license for WISP. If you are
            upgrading from a previous release the machine will already
            be licensed and you can skip this step. 

            NOTE: You must be logged on as ROOT user to run wlicense.

            % /usr/local/wisp.XXXX/bin/wlicense


        6)  Next you will need to build a new COBOL runtime system.

            The procedure for building a COBOL runtime is fully documented
            in the unix makefiles for each COBOL.  Please READ the
            instructions at the beginning of the makefile before
            proceeding.

            For ACUCOBOL the instructions are in acu/wruncbl.umf.

            Ex.
                $ WISPDIR=/usr/local/wisp.XXXX
                $ ACUDIR=/usr/local/acucobol
                $ export WISPDIR ACUDIR
                $ cd $WISPDIR/acu
                $ make -e -f wruncbl.umf

            For Micro Focus the instructions are in wisp/mf/wrunmf.umf.

            Ex.
                $ WISPDIR=/usr/local/wisp.XXXX
                $ export WISPDIR
                $ cd $WISPDIR/mf
                $ make -e -f wrunmf.umf


        7)  Setup the UNIX runtime environment.

            See Appendix B "Setting Up The Runtime Environment" of the
            WISP manual for a complete description. 


        8)  Check the environment setup by running the wdiag utility.

                $ /usr/local/wisp.XXXX/bin/wdiag

            This utility will detect and report problems with the setup.

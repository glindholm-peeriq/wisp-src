# CHARMAP - Character Map
#
# This file is used to map Wang 7-bit characters into Native and Terminal
# 8-bit characters.
#
# The Wang workstation will only display characters with values in the 
# range 1-127 (7-bit).  High value 128-255 (8-bit) are considered to be 
# FAC characters not data.  On a Wang workstation non-ASCII characters 
# are represented with values 1-31, and 123-127 which are "unused" by 
# the ASCII character-set.
#
# On Unix and Windows, non-ASCII characters are usually represented
# with values in the range 128-255.  These non-ASCII characters in the 
# range 128-255 would be confused with FAC characters and would not be 
# displayed by the WISP screen handler.  In order to display these
# characters they need to be mapped into unused values of the Wang 
# workstation character set. 
#
# The Wang 7-bit character set is used by the WISP screen handler to
# emulate Wang workstion IO.  The Native character set is the character
# set used natively by this computer, this is usually the ANSI
# character set with "Latin 1" extensions.  The Terminal character
# set is character set use by the terminal (this may be the same
# as the native character set).
#
# Comment lines begin with a hash (#) character.
#
# Each mapping line contains three decimal numbers. The first number 
# is the 7-bit Wang workstation character value.  The second number
# is the corresponding 8-bit native character value (ANSI). The third
# number is the corresponding 8-bit terminal character set value.
#
# The character value 0 can not be mapped.
#
# It is recommended that you restrict Wang character values to those
# which are not used by the ASCII standard (1-31,127). You could 
# additionally use values that are different between Wang and
# ASCII (94-96,123-126).
#
# It is strongly recommended that you do not remap any of the standard
# ASCII characters ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z', '0'-'9', etc). You should also 
# not use value 11 which is the pseudo-blank character and is handled 
# with a special mechanism.  Additionally the values 8 - 13 are very
# common ASCII control characters and if remapped may cause problems
# when using the DISPLAY or VSEDIT utility.
#
# On most Unix systems the Native and the Terminal character values
# will be the same.  On most Windows systems the Native character 
# values are from the ANSI character set (Windows code page 1252), 
# and the Terminal character values are from the OEM character set 
# (Windows code page 437).
#
# The sample mapping provided is a close approximation to the default
# Wang workstation character set.  The Native values used are
# from the ISO 8859-1 Latin 1 character set which is also compatible
# with the Windows Latin 1 character set (Microsoft calls this ANSI).
#
# Test any changes you make by re-running wshell and pressing PF28
# from the main menu.

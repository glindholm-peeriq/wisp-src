	AMU - WISP APPLICATION MANAGEMENT UTILITY
	=========================================

	The WISP AMU Utility allows you to run your Wang VS
	AMU menus in a WISP runtime environment.

	AMU is based on a product by Wang Laboratories, Inc.  It is not,
	however, a complete 100% emulation.


	Distribution & Installation
	---------------------------

	First install the WISP runtime and setup the WISP runtime
	environment.  This must be in place before AMU can be used.

	AMU will normally be distributed on diskette or tape as a 
	compressed tar file named "amuXXX.tar.Z".  Unload this file
	from the distribution media as follows.

	E.g.	$ tar -xvf /dev/rfd0

	Extract the distribution files from "amuXXXtar.Z" using the 
	following command:

		$ uncompress -c amuXXX.tar.Z|tar -xvpf -

	This will create a directory "amuXXX where XXX is a version
	number.  This directory will contain two files: Info, amu.txt
	(this document) and three subdirectories: amuamu.XXX, amumf.XXX,
	and source.  Each kit contains both ACUCOBOL and Micro Focus
	COBOL distributions as well as the source set to re-build
	either distribution.


	For Micro Focus COBOL distribution:
	-----------------------------------
	The following files will be created within amumf.XXX.

		AMU.int		- Runtime call driver progam
		AMUROOT.int	- Runtime root program

		AMUEDIT.int	- Maintenance program
		AMUMDM.int	- Menu Definition Maintenance subprogram
		AMUFKM.int	- Function Key Maintenance subprogram
		AMUUDM.int	- User Definition Maintenance subprogram

		CAMUMENU.int	- Menu conversion program

	Edit configuration or move *.int files to a path on your COBPATH.

	For AcuCOBOL distribution:
	--------------------------
	The following files will be created within amuacu.XXX.

		AMU		- Runtime call driver progam
		AMUROOT		- Runtime root program

		AMUEDIT		- Maintenance program
		AMUMDM		- Menu Definition Maintenance subprogram
		AMUFKM		- Function Key Maintenance subprogram
		AMUUDM		- User Definition Maintenance subprogram

		CAMUMENU	- Menu conversion program


	Edit ACUCONFIG or move object files to a path on your CODE-PREFIX.


	AMU Usage
	-----------

	The following shows the usage of AMU:

		$ runtime AMU



	Using AMU with Wang VS Procedures
	-----------------------------------

	AMU and WISP recognize the following file extensions as being
	Wang VS Procedures:

		xxx.wps		Wang Procedure Source
		xxx.wpr		Wang Procedure Run (compiled)


	Environment Variables
	---------------------



	Current Limitations
	-------------------

	This section describes current known limitations of AMU, there 
	may be other limitations that have not yet been documented.



	REVISION SUMMARY
	================

	This section describes the changes that have occurred with each 
	release plus any reported outstanding issues.

	Release 1.0
	-----------

	Initial release of the AMU Utility.


	Release 1.1
	-----------

	Modified the way version control was handled.  There is now a
	copy member version.wcb which contains this information.


	Outstanding Issues
	------------------

	The following issues have been reported and are waiting correction
	or verification.


	There are known issues with cursor control and FAC attributes
	when using AMUEDIT.  Currently there is no schedule to resolve
	any problems.  The source is provided for ability to make any
	time critical modifications yourself.

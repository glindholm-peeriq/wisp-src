Title:          Build WISP for Acucobol 6.0 ATM Runtime (WIN32)

Document:       build_wisp_acu60atm_rts.txt
Products:       WISP/WIN32
Versions:       5.0.00

Summary:        Instructions to build Acucobol 6.0 ATM runtime.
                This ATM runtime is used with the WISP NT Telnet.

====================================================================

Follow these instructions carefully to build a custom Acucobol ATM
(Alternate Terminal Manager) runtime that includes the WISP runtime 
routines.  

In these instructions these macros are used as follows:

${ACUDIR}  - Acucobol-GT 6.0 ATM dir (C:\Acucorp\acucbl600\acugt)
${WISPDIR} - WISP installation dir   (C:\WISP5000)

Acucobol 6.0 requires that you rebuild the run32.exe file in order 
to add C routines to the runtime.  This procedure will create a 
new run32_wisp.exe executable file.

The build is performed in the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder which is 
normally C:\acucorp\acucbl600\lib.  If you do not want to make 
changes to this folder then you may take a copy of it and work with 
the copy.  If you have installed Acucobol in a different location 
then you may need to adjust these instructions.

1) Copy the following WISP files into the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder.

    ${WISPDIR}\lib\wisp.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\lib\video.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wisp_sub85_inc.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wispicon.ico
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu60\sub85.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu60\run32.rc
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu60\run32_wisp_acu60.mak
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu60\run32_wisp_acu60.dsp

2)  Open the file ${ACUDIR}\lib\run32_wisp_acu60.dsp in
Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Developer Studio.  You should be able to 
simply double-click on ${ACUDIR}\lib\run32_wisp_acu60.dsp.

3) From the Build menu select "Rebuild All".  
This will build run32_wisp.exe. It should complete without errors.

4) In order to use the new runtime you will need to copy the new 
${ACUDIR}\lib\run32_wisp.exe to ${ACUDIR}\bin.

You should notice that the new run32_wisp.exe is larger then the 
original run32.exe and has the current date.

You will also need to copy and rename the Acucobol license file
to match the new runtime name. Copy ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.alc to 
${ACUDIR}\bin\run32_wisp.alc.

5) Edit ${WISPCONFIG}\wrun.cfg and change the path to the runtime.
The path of the Acucobol runtime is ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32_wisp.exe.

   RUNCBL=C:\acucorp\acucbl600\acugt\bin\run32_wisp.exe
   or 
   RUNCBL=\\SERVER\ACUDIR\bin\run32_wisp.exe

#
#	Function:
#		The UNIX makefile for building the ACUCOBOL runtime
#		systems that include the WISP runtime routines.
#
#		This makefile is for building the statically linked
#		version of the Acucobol runtime. To build the Shared
#		version see the platform and version specific
#		makefiles:
#			acu/acu102/Makefile_aix71_32sh.mak
#			acu/acu91/Makefile_hpux1123_ia_32sh.mak
#
#	Description:
#		This makefile can generate the following versions
#		of the ACUCOBOL runtime system.
#
#		wruncbl		The standard runtime for ACUCOBOL.
#
#		wruncblk	The KCSI version of the runtime.
#
#
#	Instructions:
#		Edit the file acucobol.include and follow the instructions
#		to select the version of ACUCOBOL you are using.
#
#		To create an ACUCOBOL runtime system position to 
#		the wisp/acu directory and run the "make" utility 
#		using this file as input.
#
#		This makefile requires instructions on how to find
#		the WISP libraries and the ACUCOBOL files. This is
#		done using the variables WISPDIR and ACUDIR.
#
#			WISPDIR = The installed WISP directory
#			ACUDIR  = The ACUCOBOL-GT directory
#
#		There are two methods of providing this information.
#
#		Method A:
#		---------
#		Edit this file and change WISPDIR and ACUDIR to 
#		point to the correct locations.
#
#			WISPDIR=/opt/wisp
#			ACUDIR=/opt/acu
#
#		To build a standard runtime:
#			$ cd $WISPDIR/acu
#			$ make -f wruncbl.umf
#
#		To build a KCSI runtime:
#			$ cd $WISPDIR/acu
#			$ make -f wruncbl.umf kcsi
#
#
#		Method B:
#		---------
#		Set WISPDIR and ACUDIR as environment variables
#		then use the "-e" flag with make. (The -e flag causes the
#		environment variables to override the internal variables.)
#
#			$ WISPDIR=/opt/wisp
#			$ ACUDIR=/opt/acu
#			$ export WISPDIR ACUDIR
#
#		To build a standard runtime:
#			$ cd $WISPDIR/acu
#			$ make -f wruncbl.umf -e
#
#		To build a KCSI runtime:
#			$ cd $WISPDIR/acu
#			$ make -f wruncbl.umf -e kcsi
#
#	Targets:
#		When running the make utility you can specify what "targets"
#		to create.  You specify a target by adding it to the end
#		of the make command.
#
#		Usage:	make -f wruncbl.umf [-e] [targets...]
#
#		The following targets are recognized in this makefile.
#		Each target that builds a runtime has a corresponding macro 
#		which can be used to change the name of the runtime.
#
#		rts		The default WISP + ACUCOBOL runtime.
#				Runtime = wruncbl
#				Macro   = RTS
#
#		kcsi		The KCSI runtime.
#				Runtime = wruncblk
#				Macro   = RTSK
#
#
#		clean		This target is used to remove any files 
#				created by this makefile.
#
#		Examples:
#
#		(1) Build the KCSI runtime using the name "wrunkcsi". (Method B)
#
#			$ cd $WISPDIR/acu
#			$ make -f wruncbl.umf -e RTSE=wrunkcsi kcsi
#
#
#	NOTE:	This makefile supports different versions of ACUCOBOL.
#		Depending on the version of ACUCOBOL you are using you
#		may have to modifiy the file acucobol.include found in the
#		acu directory of the WISP Toolkit.  See the section on
#		changing version settings located in acucobol.include.
#
#	NOTE:	On some systems the curses library is located in a different
#		location, see LIBCURSES below.

Summary:        Instructions to build Acucobol 10.2 runtime.

====================================================================

Required Software: 
	Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 C++


Follow these instructions carefully to build a custom Acucobol 
runtime that includes the WISP runtime routines.  

In these instructions these macros are used as follows:

${ACUDIR}     - Acucobol-GT 10.2 directory (C:\....\Micro Focus\extend10.2.0\AcuGT)
${ACUBLD}\lib - A copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib for performing the build (e.g. C:\data\acucbl1020\AcuGT\lib)
${WISPDIR}    - WISP installation directory (C:\WISP5121)

Acucobol 10.2 requires that you rebuild the wrun32.dll file in order 
to add C routines to the runtime.

The build requires all of the files in the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder plus 
additions. Newer versions of Windows may not allow you to modify files 
that have been installed under folder "C:\Program Files\".  For these 
reasons it is recommended that you install Acucobol in a custom location
that is not under "C:\Program Files\" (or "C:\Program Files (x86)\").
It is also highly recommended that you take a copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib 
and perform the build in the copy folder. ${ACUBLD}\lib in the 
instructions below refer to the copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib that will be used 
for the build.

0) Copy $(ACUDIR)\lib to $(ACUBLD)\lib

1) Copy the following WISP files into the ${ACUBLD}\lib folder.

    ${WISPDIR}\lib\wisp.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\lib\video.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wisp_sub85_inc.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu102\sub85.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu102\wrundll.vcxproj


2) Open the file ${ACUBLD}\lib\wrun32.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  

3) Select "Release" from the configuration manager, then from the Build 
menu select "Rebuild Solution".  This will build wrun32.dll. 
It should complete without errors (there may be warnings).

4) In order to use the new runtime you will need to copy the new 
${ACUBLD}\lib\wrun32.dll to ${ACUDIR}\bin\wrun32.dll and 
overwrite the wrun32.dll that came with Acucobol.
If you wish to preserve the original wrun32.dll then you will need 
to rename it or copy it to a different location 

You should notice that the new wrun32.dll is larger then the 
original and has the current date.

5) Edit ${WISPCONFIG}\wrun.cfg and change the path to the runtime.
The path of the Acucobol runtime is ${ACUDIR}\bin\wrun32.exe.

   RUNCBL=C:\....\Micro Focus\extend10.2.0\AcuGT\bin\wrun32.exe
   or 
   RUNCBL=\\SERVER\ACUDIR\bin\wrun32.exe

The file wrun32.exe is supplied by Acucobol and it can not be 
renamed.  If you wish to move it to a different location then 
you will also need to move all of the .dll files in the 
${ACUDIR}\bin folder (or set the PATH correctly). You will 
also need to move the wrun32.alc license file.

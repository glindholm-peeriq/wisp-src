Summary:        Instructions to build Acucobol 10.2 ATM runtime.

====================================================================

Required Software: 
	Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 C++


Follow these instructions carefully to build a custom Acucobol 
Alternate Terminal Manager (ATM) runtime that includes the WISP 
runtime routines.  

In these instructions these macros are used as follows:

${ACUDIR}     - Acucobol-GT 10.2 directory (C:\....\Micro Focus\extend10.2.0\AcuGT)
${ACUBLD}\lib - A copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib for performing the build (e.g. C:\data\acucbl1020\AcuGT\lib)
${WISPDIR}    - WISP installation directory (C:\WISP5100)

This procedure will rebuild ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe the ATM runtime.

If you wish to preserve the original ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe then 
you will need to rename it or copy it to a different location.

The build requires all of the files in the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder plus 
additions. Newer versions of Windows may not allow you to modify files 
that have been installed under folder "C:\Program Files\".  For these 
reasons it is recommended that you install Acucobol in a custom location
that is not under "C:\Program Files\" (or "C:\Program Files (x86)\").
It is also highly recommended that you take a copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib 
and perform the build in the copy folder. ${ACUBLD}\lib in the 
instructions below refer to the copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib that will be used 
for the build.

0) Copy $(ACUDIR)\lib to $(ACUBLD)\lib

1) Copy the following WISP files into the ${ACUBLD}\lib folder.

    ${WISPDIR}\lib\wisp.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\lib\video.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wisp_sub85_inc.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu102\sub85.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu102\run32.vcxproj

	
2) Open the file ${ACUBLD}\lib\run32.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.  

3) Select "Release" from the configuration manager, then from 
the Build menu select "Rebuild Solution".  
This will build ${ACUBLD}\lib\run32.exe.
It should complete without errors (there are many warnings).

You should notice that the new run32.exe is larger then the 
original and has the current date.

4) Copy the new ${ACUBLD}\lib\run32.exe to ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe and 
overwrite the run32.exe that came with Acucobol.
If you wish to preserve the original run32.exe then you will need 
to rename it or copy it to a different location 

You should notice that the new run32.exe is larger then the 
original and has the current date.

5) Edit ${WISPCONFIG}\wrun.cfg and change the path to the runtime.
The path of the Acucobol runtime is ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe.

   RUNCBL=C:\....\Micro Focus\extend10.2.0\AcuGT\bin\run32.exe
   or 
   RUNCBL=\\SERVER\ACUDIR\bin\run32.exe

If you wish to move the run32.exe file to a different location then 
you will also need to move all of the .dll files in the 
${ACUDIR}\bin folder (or set the PATH correctly). You will 
also need to move the run32.alc license file.

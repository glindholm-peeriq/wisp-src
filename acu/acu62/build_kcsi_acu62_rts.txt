Title:          Build KCSI for Acucobol 6.2 Runtime (WIN32)

Document:       build_kcsi_acu62_rts.txt
Products:       KCSI/WIN32
Versions:       4.1.00

Summary:        Instructions to build Acucobol 6.2 runtime.

====================================================================

Follow these instructions carefully to build a custom Acucobol 
runtime that includes the WISP and KCSI runtime routines.  

In these instructions these macros are used as follows:

${ACUDIR}  - Acucobol-GT 6.2 directory   (C:\Acucorp\acucbl620\acugt)
${WISPDIR} - WISP installation directory (C:\WISP5001)
${KCSIDIR} - KCSI installation directory (C:\KCSIACU4100)

Acucobol 6.2 requires that you rebuild the wrun32.dll file in order 
to add C routines to the runtime.

The build is performed in the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder which is 
normally C:\acucorp\acucbl620\lib.  If you do not want to make 
changes to this folder then you may take a copy of it and work with 
the copy.  If you have installed Acucobol in a different location 
then you may need to adjust these instructions.

1) Copy the following WISP and KCSI files into the 
${ACUDIR}\lib folder.

    ${WISPDIR}\lib\wisp.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\lib\video.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wisp_sub85_inc.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wispicon.ico
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu62\sub85.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu62\wisp.rc
    ${KCSIDIR}\kcsiacu.lib 
    ${KCSIDIR}\kcsi_sub85_inc.c 
    ${KCSIDIR}\acu62\wrundll.vcproj 



2)  Open the file ${ACUDIR}\lib\wrun32.sln in Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 
(Visual Studio .Net 2003).  You should be able to simply double-click 
on ${ACUDIR}\lib\wrun32.sln.

3) Select "Release" from the configuration manager, then from the Build 
menu select "Rebuild Solution".  This will build wrun32.dll. 
It should complete without errors (there are warnings).

4) In order to use the new runtime you will need to copy the new 
${ACUDIR}\lib\wrun32.dll to ${ACUDIR}\bin\wrun32.dll 
and overwrite the wrun32.dll that came with Acucobol.
If you wish to preserve the original wrun32.dll then you will need 
to rename it or copy it to a different location 

You should notice that the new wrun32.dll is larger then the 
original and has the current date.

5) Edit ${WISPCONFIG}\wrun.cfg and change the path to the runtime.
The path of the Acucobol runtime is ${ACUDIR}\bin\wrun32.exe.

   RUNCBL=C:\acucorp\acucbl620\acugt\bin\wrun32.exe
   or 
   RUNCBL=\\SERVER\ACUDIR\bin\wrun32.exe

The file wrun32.exe is supplied by Acucobol and it can not be 
renamed.  If you wish to move it to a different location then 
you will also need to move all of the .dll files in the 
${ACUDIR}\bin folder (or set the PATH correctly). You will 
also need to move the wrun32.alc license file.

Summary:        Instructions to build Acucobol 9.0.x Console runtime.

====================================================================

Required Software: 
	Microsoft Visual Studio 2008
	

Follow these instructions carefully to build a custom Acucobol 
Console runtime that includes the WISP and EDE runtime routines.  

In these instructions these macros are used as follows:

${ACUDIR}     - Acucobol-GT 9.0.x directory (C:\....\Micro Focus\acucbl90x\AcuGT)
${ACUBLD}\lib - A copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib for performing the build (e.g. C:\data\acucbl90x\AcuGT\lib)
${WISPDIR}    - WISP installation directory (C:\WISP5100)
${EDEDIR}     - EDE installation directory (C:\EDE5100)

This procedure will rebuild ${ACUDIR}\bin\crun32.exe the Console runtime.

If you wish to preserve the original ${ACUDIR}\bin\crun32.exe then 
you will need to rename it or copy it to a different location.

The build requires all of the files in the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder plus 
additions. Newer versions of Windows may not allow you to modify files 
that have been installed under folder "C:\Program Files\".  For these 
reasons it is recommended that you install Acucobol in a custom location
that is not under "C:\Program Files\" (or "C:\Program Files (x86)\").
It is also highly recommended that you take a copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib 
and perform the build in the copy folder. ${ACUBLD}\lib in the 
instructions below refer to the copy of ${ACUDIR}\lib that will be used 
for the build.

1) Copy the following WISP and EDE files into the ${ACUBLD}\lib folder.

    ${WISPDIR}\lib\wisp.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\lib\video.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wisp_sub85_inc.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wispicon.ico
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu90\sub85.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu90\wisp.rc
    ${EDEDIR}\ede.lib 
    ${EDEDIR}\acu90\sub.c
    ${EDEDIR}\acu90\crun32.vcproj

2)  Open the file ${ACUBLD}\lib\crun32.sln in Microsoft Visual Studio/C++.  
You should be able to simply double-click on ${ACUBLD}\lib\crun32.sln.

3) Select "Release" from the configuration manager, then from 
the Build menu select "Rebuild Solution".  
This will build ${ACUDIR}\bin\crun32.exe.
It should complete without errors (there are many warnings).

You should notice that the new crun32.exe is larger then the 
original and has the current date.

4) Edit ${WISPCONFIG}\wrun.cfg and change the path to the runtime.
The path of the Acucobol runtime is ${ACUDIR}\bin\crun32.exe.

   RUNCBL=C:\....\Micro Focus\acucbl90x\AcuGT\bin\crun32.exe
   or 
   RUNCBL=\\SERVER\ACUDIR\bin\crun32.exe

If you wish to move the crun32.exe file to a different location then 
you will also need to move all of the .dll files in the 
${ACUDIR}\bin folder (or set the PATH correctly). You will 
also need to move the crun32.alc license file.

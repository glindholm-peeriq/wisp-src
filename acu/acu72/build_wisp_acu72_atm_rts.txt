Summary:        Instructions to build Acucobol 7.2.x ATM runtime.

====================================================================

Follow these instructions carefully to build a custom Acucobol 
Alternate Terminal Manager (ATM) runtime that includes the WISP 
runtime routines.  

In these instructions these macros are used as follows:

${ACUDIR}  - Acucobol-GT 7.2.x directory (C:\Acucorp\acucbl72x\acugt)
${WISPDIR} - WISP installation directory (C:\WISP5001)

This procedure will rebuild ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe the ATM runtime.

If you wish to preserve the original ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe then 
you will need to rename it or copy it to a different location.

The build is performed in the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder which is 
normally C:\acucorp\acucbl72x\lib.  If you do not want to make 
changes to this folder then you may take a copy of it and work with 
the copy.  If you have installed Acucobol in a different location 
then you may need to adjust these instructions.

1) Copy the following WISP files into the ${ACUDIR}\lib folder.

    ${WISPDIR}\lib\wisp.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\lib\video.lib
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wisp_sub85_inc.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\wispicon.ico
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu72\sub85.c
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu72\wisp.rc
    ${WISPDIR}\acu\acu72\run32.vcproj

2)  Open the file ${ACUDIR}\lib\run32.sln in Microsoft Visual C++ 7.1 
(Visual Studio .Net 2003).  You should be able to simply double-click 
on ${ACUDIR}\lib\run32.sln.

3) Select "Release" from the configuration manager, then from 
the Build menu select "Rebuild Solution".  
This will build ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe.
It should complete without errors (there are many warnings).

You should notice that the new run32.exe is larger then the 
original and has the current date.

4) Edit ${WISPCONFIG}\wrun.cfg and change the path to the runtime.
The path of the Acucobol runtime is ${ACUDIR}\bin\run32.exe.

   RUNCBL=C:\acucorp\acucbl72x\acugt\bin\run32.exe
   or 
   RUNCBL=\\SERVER\ACUDIR\bin\run32.exe

The file run32.exe is supplied by Acucobol and it can not be 
renamed.  If you wish to move it to a different location then 
you will also need to move all of the .dll files in the 
${ACUDIR}\bin folder (or set the PATH correctly). You will 
also need to move the run32.alc license file.

CHANGES FROM 3.0.03 TO 3.0.04
=============================
Fixed several problems with Relative files.  In DATENTRY Read Next and
Read Previous would always report you had reach the end/beginning of
the file.


CHANGES FROM 3.0.02 TO 3.0.03
=============================
Fixed problem with Micro Focus version when REPORT encountered a
locked record in the data file.

Enhanced error reporting so that CRID now uses the same mechanism as
WISP.  Critical errors will be displayed to the user and logged in the
$HOME/wisperr.log file.

Enhanced the runtime trace facility. To enable set the environment
variable KCSITRACE=1 and the trace will be written to
$HOME/wisperr.log file.


CHANGES FROM 3.0.01 TO 3.0.02
=============================
Enhanced to be compatible with Acucobol-GT 5.2.

Fixed problem in REPORT when running a report with DEVICE=DISPLAY it
was also printing the report.


CHANGES FROM 3.0.00 TO 3.0.01
=============================
The Micro Focus version of REPORT utility on HP-UX 11 was sometimes
failing while running a report if the report had a sort component. It
would fill the kcsierr.log file until disk space limits were reached.


CHANGES FROM 2.99 TO 3.0.00
===========================
The CRID version number has changed to a three part, four
digit number.

Verified compatible with Acucobol-GT 5.1.

The standard WISP for Acucobol makefile wruncbl.umf is now
distributed with the Acucobol release (instead of the earlier
wruncblk.umf file). The makefile wruncbl.umf now contains a
target "crid" that will build wruncblk the WISP + CRID
runtime. 

In INQUIRY the default for saved inquiries is now a WPROC .wps
file instead of a shell script.  To save as a shell script set
the environment variable "KCSIGENWPROC=NO".


CHANGES FROM 2.98 TO 2.99
=========================
The INQUIRY and REPORT utilities were ignoring "Data Limit"
options (A EQ 'X') thus returning all records. This bug was
introduced in 2.97 and has been corrected.


CHANGES FROM 2.97 TO 2.98
=========================
Support has been added for ACUCOBOL-GT 4.3 on WIN32.


CHANGES FROM 2.96 TO 2.97
=========================
The REPORT utility was unable to properly handle duplicate
field names when multiple control files were used.  This has
been corrected.


CHANGES FROM 2.95 TO 2.96
=========================
The REPORT utility function "Print a Report" would garble the
screen when Output DEVICE = DISPLAY was set.  The DISPLAY utility
would run and when finished the REPORT screens would have parts of
the display visable on the screen.  This problem has been
corrected when linked with version 4.3.04 of the WISP library.


CHANGES FROM 2.94 TO 2.95
=========================
For the ACUCOBOL version of CRID the cobol sources were compiled
with the -C32 and -Z32 flags to allow CRID to be used with a
version 3.2 of ACUCOBOL runtime system.

CRID for Micro Focus was failing to properly mark a relative
record deleted. This has been corrected.


CHANGES FROM 2.93 TO 2.94
=========================
An error was introduced in 2.93 that caused data files with
non-duplicate alternate keys to be flagged as duplicate alternate
keys.  This could cause a data file to appear to not match it's
control file.  This only effects CRID for Micro Focus version 2.93
and has been corrected in this release.


CHANGES FROM 2.92 TO 2.93
=========================
DATENTRY for Micro Focus COBOL: was failing on DIGITAL UNIX,
SOLARIS and SCO when used with CISAM files. This has been
corrected.

DATENTRY for Micro Foucs COBOL: The create file option was not
adding the duplicate flag for duplicate alternate keys. This has
been corrected.

DATENTRY for Micro Focus COBOL: On exit a Signal 11 would
sometimes occur. This has been corrected.


CHANGES FROM 2.91 TO 2.92
=========================
DATENTRY was not correctly handling non-updateable fields with an
occurs value.

DATENTRY was sometimes failing when displaying numeric fields with
no decimal positions before the decimal point. (e.g. PIC .999)


CHANGES FROM 2.90 TO 2.91
=========================
Upgrade to WISP 4.2.00


CHANGES FROM 2.84 TO 2.90
=========================
Micro Focus COBOL:  The file I/O is now processed through the
use of the extended file handler ExtFH().  DISAM is no longer a
requirement for building the tools.  The ability to now process
the extended file formats IDXFORMAT"3" and IDXFORMAT"4" files
is now available.


CHANGES FROM 2.83 TO 2.84
=========================
Added support for RDBMS when using Acu4GL.

To use:  There is no additional configuration required for use with
the Acu4GL interface.  Make sure the runtime configuration for
Acu4GL is properly setup.  Create a new runtime which includes the
appropriate file systems.

RESTRICTIONS:

- Control and Report files will remain in the Vision file system.

- XFD file name must match the Wang style file name.

CONTROL and REPORT previously were limited to 300 fields, this has
been increased in 2.79 to allow up to 500 fields.

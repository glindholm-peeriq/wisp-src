        Summary:        Installation instructins for the CREATE tool for unix
                        with Micro Focus COBOL or ACUCOBOL.

        ==================================================================== 
 

        INSTALLATION
        ============

        First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
        must be in place before create can be used.

        CREATE will normally be distributed on diskette or tape as a
        compressed tar file.

                Micro Focus:    createmfx.XXXX.tar.Z
                ACUCOBOL:       createacu.XXXX.tar.Z

        It is recommended that you install CREATE in your WISP directory
        ($WISPDIR).  Unload this file from the distribution media as
        follows: 

                $ cd $WISPDIR 
                $ tar -xvf /dev/rfd0

        Extract the distribution files from the compressed tar file using
        the following command:

        Micro Focus:
                $ uncompress -c createmfx.XXXX.tar.Z|tar -xvpf -
        ACUCOBOL:
                $ uncompress -c createacu.XXXX.tar.Z|tar -xvpf -

        This will create a directory "createmfx.XXXX" ("createacu.XXXX" for
        ACUCOBOL) where XXXX is a version number.  Refer to packlist.txt
        in the distribution for a listing of expected files.

 
        Configuration
        -------------
 
        Copy the create executable to a program directory or a directory
        on your path.

        Test your installation by running the utilites:

                $ create
 
        NOTE:  If there is any problem running create, proceed to
               the steps for MAKING THE UTILITY below.

        ====================================================================

           *********************************************************
                The following instructions are only needed if
                you could not run the distribution executable 
                or if you need to relink the executable.
           *********************************************************

        RELINKING THE UTILITIES
        -----------------------

        1. Copy the distribution into a directory on the user's path.
 
        2. Ensure that the COBOL compiler will run in this directory.
 
        3. Once this is complete, you may build the create utility.

           a.  Edit the make file create.umf.  The make file contains
               instructions for building the utility. This make file
               needs to be edited to correctly reflect the location of
               the wisp libraries.

           b.  Locate the WISP libraries and edit the value for:
 
                WISPDIR=/usr/local/wisp

           c.  Verify and uncomment the correct curses library location.

                CURSES_LINK = -lcurses

           d.  ACUCOBOL:  Confirm the versin of ACUCOBOL that you are
                          using and correclty comment and uncomment the
                          ACULIBS, ACUSUBS, and ACUTEST variables.

                # 2     ACUCOBOL Version 2.0 - 2.3.2
                #
                ACULIBS=$(ACULIBS2)
                ACUSUBS=$(ACUSUBS2)
                ACUTEST=$(ACUTEST2)
                #
 
        4. Now the utility may be built:

           Micro Focus COBOL:

                        $ make -f create.umf mfxcreate
 
           ACUCOBOL:

                        $ make -f create.umf
 
                   or if you are creating an EDE version type
 
                        $ make -f create.umf acucreatee
 
        5. Once the make process is complete, the create executable
           will exist in the working directory, and may be moved to any
           suitable directory on the path and renamed create.

           NOTE: create is a full executable, and does not require
                 any run time.

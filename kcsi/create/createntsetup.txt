	CREATE for Acucobol NT/95 Setup
	===============================

	This document describes the steps for installing and setting up
	the CREATE utility for Acucobol on MicroSoft Windows NT/95.


	Overview
	--------

	1) Ensure WISP is installed first.
	2) Uninstall previous versions of CREATE.
	3) Install CREATE for Acucobol.
	4) How to rebuild CREATE.


	The Steps
	---------

	1) Ensure WISP is installed first.

	    WISP must be installed first before you can install CREATE.
	    Ensure you have WISP installed and configured before
	    continuing.

	2) Uninstall previous versions of CREATE.

 	    If CREATE is already installed on this machine then first
	    uninstall the previous verion.  Use "Add/Remove programs" from
	    the Control Panel to remove the previous version.

	3) Install CREATE for Acucobol.

	    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
	    b) Run A:SETUP

	    IMPORTANT: Install CREATE into the same directory where WISP
	    is installed.  This will default to "C:\WISP".

	    The following instructions assume you have installed WISP in
	    directory C:\WISP .  If you have installed WISP into a
	    different location the adjust the instructions accordingly.

	4) How to rebuild CREATE.

	    If you upgrade to a newer version of Acucobol you may wish to
	    rebuild CREATE using the new Acucobol.

	    a) Ensure new version of ACUCOBOL is installed and the
	       Acucobol BIN directory is on the PATH.

	          PATH %PATH%;C:\ACUCBL3X\BIN

	    b) Ensure MicroSoft Visual C++ 4 is installed.
	    c) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window
	    d) Run C:\Msdev\Bin\Vcvars32.bat from Visual C++ to enable you
	       to build from the command prompt.
	    e) Change to the CREATE directory: cd C:\WISP\CREATEACU.20
	    f) Edit WWRUNCBL.MAK 

	       Change ACUDIR to the location where Acucobol was installed.

	           ACUDIR=C:\ACUCBL3X

	       Change CREATEDIR to the location of the CREATE directory.

		   CREATEDIR=C:\WISP\CREATEACU.20

	    g) Issue the command to build the new CREATE.

	           C:> nmake /f wwruncbl.mak create

	    h) Copy the new create utility to the WISP\BIN directory.

	           C:> copy create.exe C:\WISP\BIN

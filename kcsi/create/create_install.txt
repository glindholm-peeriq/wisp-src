Summary:        Installation instructins for the CREATE tool for unix
                with Micro Focus COBOL or ACUCOBOL.

==================================================================== 


INSTALLATION
============

First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
must be in place before create can be used.

CREATE will normally be distributed on CDROM as a tar file.

        Micro Focus:    create_mf_XXXX.tar
        ACUCOBOL:       create_acu_XXXX.tar

It is recommended that you install CREATE in your WISP directory
($WISPDIR). 

Extract the distribution files from the tar file using the following
command:

Micro Focus:
        $ cd $WISPDIR 
        $ tar -xvpf create_mf_XXXX.tar
ACUCOBOL:
        $ cd $WISPDIR 
        $ tar -xvpf create_acu_XXXX.tar

This will create a directory "create_mf_XXXX" ("create_acu_XXXX" for 
ACUCOBOL) where XXXX is a version number.  Refer to
create_packlist.txt in the distribution for a listing of expected
files. 


Configuration
-------------

Copy the create executable to a directory on your path of add the
create directory to your $PATH.

Test your installation by running the utility:

        $ create

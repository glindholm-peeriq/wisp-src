The following items describe corrections and improvements that
have been made from release 3.4 to release 3.5.00.

The version numbering has been change to a three part four
digit format.

The Acucobol version was built with Acucobol-GT 5.1.

The Output FORMAT field has been removed from the Acucobol

Acucobol mechanism.


CHANGES FROM 3.3 TO 3.4
=======================
The following items describe corrections and improvements that
have been made from release 3.3 to release 3.4.

CREATE has been updated to the latest version of the WISP
libraries, currently WISP 4.3.04.


CHANGES FROM 3.2 TO 3.3
=======================
The following items describe corrections and improvements that
have been made from release 3.2 to release 3.3.

CREATE for Micro Focus COBOL was failing to add the duplicate flag
for duplicate alternate keys.  This has been corrected.


CHANGES FROM 3.1 TO 3.2
=======================
The following items describe corrections and improvements that
have been made from release 3.1 to release 3.2.

ACUCOBOL: The CREATE utility does not obey the V-VERSION option in
the Acucobol A_CONFIG file.  It was always creating Vision 4
files. It has been changed to default to creating Vision 3 files
unless the environment variable V_VERSION=4 is set.

ACUCOBOL: A FORMAT keyword has been added to the OUTPUT GETPARM
screen which allows you to specify the Vision Version for Indexed
files.


CHANGES FROM 2.0 TO 3.0
=======================
The following items describe corrections and improvements that
have been made from release 2.0 to release 3.0.

Micro Focus COBOL:  The file I/O is now processed through the
use of the extended file handler ExtFH().  DISAM is no longer a
requirement for building the tools.  The ability to now process
the extended file formats IDXFORMAT"3" and IDXFORMAT"4" files
is now available.  A new item FORMAT has been added to the first
user input screen PRNAME OUTPUT.  The avalable file formats are
0 = Default, 1 = C-ISAM, 2 = LEVEL II COBOL, 3 = Format used by
system, 4 = IDXFORMAT"4".  If the field is not filled in, the
defualt file format will be used.

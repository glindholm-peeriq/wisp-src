	USING EXISTING UTILITIES
	========================

	Distribution
        ------------

        First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
        must be in place before create can be used.

        CREATE will normally be distributed on diskette or tape as a
        compressed tar file.

		Micro Focus:	createmf.XXX.tar.Z
		AcuCOBOL:	createacu.XXX.tar.Z

	Unload this file from the distribution media as follows:

        E.g.    $ tar -xvf /dev/rfd0

        Extract the distribution files from the compressed tar file using
	the following command:

	Micro Focus:
                $ uncompress -c createmf.XXX.tar.Z|tar -xvpf -
	AcuCOBOL:
                $ uncompress -c createacu.XXX.tar.Z|tar -xvpf -

        This will create a directory "createmf.XXX" ("createacu.XXX" for
	AcuCOBOL) where XXX is a version number.  Refer to packlist.lis
	in the distribution for a listing of expected files.
 
	Installation
        ------------
 
	Copy the create executable to a program directory or a directory
	on your path.

	Test your installation by running the utilites:

		$ create
 
	NOTE:  If there is any problem running create, proceed to
               the steps for MAKING THE UTILITY below.

        ====================================================================

	   *********************************************************
	       If you could not run the distribution executable,
	       then continue.
	   *********************************************************

	MAKING THE UTILITY
	------------------ 
 	1. Copy the distribution into a directory on the user's path.
 
	2. Ensure that the COBOL compiler will run in this directory.
 
	3. Once this is complete, you may build the create utility.

	   a.  Edit the make file create.umf.  The make file contains
	       instructions for building the utility. This make file
	       needs to be edited to correctly reflect the location of
	       the wisp libraries.

	   b.  Locate the WISP libraries and edit the value for:
 
		WISPDIR=/usr/local/wisp

	   c.  Verify and uncomment the correct curses library location.

		CURSES_LINK = -lcurses

	   d.  AcuCOBOL:  Confirm the versin of AcuCOBOL that you are
			  using and correclty comment and uncomment the
			  ACULIBS, ACUSUBS, and ACUTEST variables.

		# 2     ACUCOBOL Version 2.0 - 2.3.2
		#
		ACULIBS=$(ACULIBS2)
		ACUSUBS=$(ACUSUBS2)
		ACUTEST=$(ACUTEST2)
		#
 
	4. Now the utility may be built:

	   Micro Focus:

			$ make -f create.umf mfcreate
 
		   or if you are creating an EDE version type
 
			$ make -f create.umf mfcreatee

	   AcuCOBOL:

			$ make -f create.umf
 
		   or if you are creating an EDE version type
 
			$ make -f create.umf acucreatee
 
	5. Once the make process is complete, the create executable
	   will exist in the working directory, and may be moved to any
	   suitable directory on the path and renamed create.

	   NOTE: create is a full executable, and does not require
	   	 any run time.

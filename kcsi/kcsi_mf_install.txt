Document:       kcsi_mf_install.txt
Products:       KCSI Utilities

Summary:        Installation instructions for the KCSI Utilities
                using the Micro Focus COBOL compiler.

====================================================================


INSTALLATION
============

First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
must be in place before KCSI can be used.

KCSI will normally be distributed as a tar.Z file named
"kcsi_mf_XXXX.tar.Z".  It is recommended that you install KCSI
in your WISP directory ($WISPDIR). 

Extract the distribution files from "kcsi_mf_XXXX.tar" using the
following tar command:

        $ cd $WISPDIR
        $ uncompress -c kcsi_mf_XXXX.tar.Z | tar -xvpf -

This will create a directory "kcsi_mf_XXXX" where XXXX is a version
number.  Refer to kcsi_packlist.txt in the distribution for a listing
of expected files.


Configuration
-------------

The utilities control/report/inquiry/datentry/create need to be on 
your $PATH. 

Add the KCSI installaton directory to your $PATH:

   $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/wisp_XXXX/kcsi_mf_XXXX


Test your installation by running the utilites:

        $ control
        $ report
        $ inquiry
        $ datentry
        $ create

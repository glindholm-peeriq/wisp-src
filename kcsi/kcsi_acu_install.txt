Summary:        Installation instructions for the KCSI Utilities
                using the ACUCOBOL compiler.

====================================================================


INSTALLATION
============

First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
must be in place before KCSI can be used.  Create a standard 
ACUCOBOL WISP runtime by following the instructions supplied
with your WISP distribution. This will ensure that all current
pieces are up to date for WISP.

KCSI will normally be distributed on CDROM as a tar file named
"kcsi_acu_XXXX.tar".  It is recommended that you install KCSI in your 
WISP directory ($WISPDIR). 

Extract the distribution files from "kcsi_acu_XXXX.tar" using the
following command:

        $ cd $WISPDIR
        $ tar -xvpf kcsi_acu_XXXX.tar

This will create a directory "kcsi_acu_XXXX" where XXXX is a version
number.  Refer to kcsi_packlist.txt in the distribution for a listing 
of expected files.


Configuration
-------------

1. Build an extended wisp runtime for the KCSI utilities:

   Read the wruncbl.umf file to determine the method for building
   the needed runtime.  The resulting output will be a file named
   wruncblk or wruncblke for an EDE version of the runtime.

        $ make -f wruncbl.umf kcsi
   or
        $ make -f wruncbl.umf kcsi_ede

2. Point to the new runtime by editing $WISPCONFIG/wrunconfig and
   setting "runcbl" to the location of the wruncblk.

   Edit $WISPCONFIG/wrunconfig to read:

        runcbl=/usr/local/wisp_XXXX/kcsi_acu_XXXX/wruncblk

   Use the file path to wruncblk that is correct for your
   installation. 

3. The files CONTROL/REPORT/INQUIRY/DATENTRY/CREATE should be on 
   your $PATH and on the Acucobol CODE_PREFIX. 

   Add the KCSI installaton directory to your $PATH:

       $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/wisp_XXXX/kcsi_acu_XXXX

   Add the KCSI installation directory to the Acucobol CODE-PREFIX in
   the Acucobol config file $A_CONFIG (usually $WISPCONFIG/ACUCONFIG).

   E.g. Edit $WISPCONFIG/ACUCONFIG:

       CODE-PREFIX /usr/local/wisp_XXXX/kcsi_acu_XXXX ...


Test your installation by running the utilites:

        $ wrun CONTROL
        $ wrun REPORT
        $ wrun INQUIRY
        $ wrun DATENTRY
        $ wrun CREATE

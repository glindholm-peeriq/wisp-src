Summary:        Installation instructions for the CRID Utilities
                using the Micro Focus COBOL compiler.

====================================================================


INSTALLATION
============

First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
must be in place before CRID can be used.

CRID will normally be distributed on CDROM as a tar file named
"crid_mf_XXXX.tar".  It is recommended that you install CRID
in your WISP directory ($WISPDIR). 

Extract the distribution files from "crid_mf_XXXX.tar" using the
following tar command:

        $ cd $WISPDIR
        $ tar -xvf crid_mf_XXXX.tar

This will create a directory "crid_mf_XXXX" where XXXX is a version
number.  Refer to crid_packlist.txt in the distribution for a listing
of expected files.


Configuration
-------------

The utilities control/report/inquiry/datentry need to be on your
$PATH. 

Add the CRID installaton directory to your $PATH:

   $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/wisp_XXXX/crid_mf_XXXX


Test your installation by running the utilites:

        $ control
        $ report
        $ inquiry
        $ datentry

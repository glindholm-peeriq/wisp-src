  Please Read carefully ! The instructions have changed from
  previous releases, and it is no longer necessary to edit
  the wruncblk.umf makefile, instead the machine type is specified
  as a command line option.
 
  0. DOS - Building a run time for DOS requires the installation
  of the Intel 386/486 C Code Builder Kit, and ensuring that the
  Intell Compiler icc.exe and the linker il32.exe are available
  on a users path.
 
  1. First create a standard Acu-COBOL WISP run time by following
  the instructions supplied with your WISP distribution. This will
  ensure that all current pieces are up to date for WISP. Complete
  the installation for the WISP system.
 
  2. To build an extended wisp run time for the CRID utilities,
  assemble the following pieces in a working directory.
 
  From The Acu-COBOL distribution:
  sub.c, sub.h, config85.c, direct.c, filetbl.o (or filetbl.c) and
  the Acu-COBOL runtime library runcbl.a for UNIX and run386.lib for
  DOS
 
 
  From the WISP distribution:
  sub85.c
  For the DOS version it is necessary to move or copy the wisp
  libraries into this working directory. These DOS libraries are
  wisp.lib, video.lib and ede.lib (if you have the ede
  version of wisp).
 
  From the CRID distribution:
  crid85.c, crid.h, cridtbl.c, crid.a and wruncblk.umf
 
  3. To compile and link run the make file by typing:
 
  make -f wruncblk.umf MACHINE
 
  MACHINE should be one of HP, SCO, SUN, AIX, ULTRIX or DOS.
  If you are building ede versions of the runtime
  then append an 'E' to the MACHINE as in
  HPE, SCOE, SUNE, AIXE, ULTRIXE or DOSE. Examples:
 
  To Build an run time for AIX type:
 
  make -f wruncblk.umf AIX
 
 
  To build an run time that includes ede for SCO machines type:
 
  make -f wruncblk.umf SCOE
 
  The resulting output will be a file named wruncblk or wruncblke for
  an ede version of the run time.
 
  4. To install. Replace the existing version of wruncbl (or
  wruncble) with wruncblk or wruncblke (wrncblke.exe for DOS versions).
 
  Edit wrunconfig (wrun.cfg for MS-DOS) to read:
 
  runcbl=wruncblk
 
  Copy CONTROL/REPORT/INQUIRY and/or DATENTRY
 
  5. To run type:
 
  wrun CONTROL (or REPORT etc.)

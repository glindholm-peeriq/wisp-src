        Summary:        Installation instructions for the CRID Utilities
			using the ACUCOBOL compiler.

        ====================================================================
 

	INSTALLATION
	============

        First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
        must be in place before CRID can be used.  Create a standard 
	ACUCOBOL WISP runtime by following the instructions supplied
	with your WISP distribution. This will ensure that all current
	pieces are up to date for WISP.

        CRID will normally be distributed on diskette or tape as a
        compressed tar file named "cridacu.XXX.tar.Z".  It is recommended
        that you install CRID in your WISP directory ($WISPDIR). Unload
        this file from the distribution media as follows.

	        $ cd $WISPDIR
                $ tar -xvf /dev/rfd0

        Extract the distribution files from "cridacu.XXX.tar.Z" using the
        following command:

                $ uncompress -c cridacu.XXX.tar.Z|tar -xvpf -

        This will create a directory "cridacu.XXX" where XXX is a version
	number.  Refer to packlist.lis in the distribution for a listing
	of expected files.
 

	Configuration
        -------------

	1. Build an extended wisp runtime for the CRID utilities:

	   ******************************************************
	   To use C-ISAM with AcuCOBOL:
 
		Edit filetbl.c supplied by AcuCOBOL.
 
		Locate the line that reads
		#define USE_CISAM 0
 
		Modify this line to read
		#define USE_CISAM 1
	   ******************************************************
	   To use Acu4GL and Oracle interface with AcuCOBOL:
 
		Edit filetbl.c supplied by AcuCOBOL.
 
		Locate the line that reads
		#define USE_ORACLE 0
 
		Modify this line to read
		#define USE_ORACLE 1
	   ******************************************************

	   Read the wruncblk.umf file to determine the method for building
	   the needed runtime.  The resulting output will be a file named
	   wruncblk or wruncblke for an ede version of the runtime.

		$ make -f wruncblk.umf
	   or
		$ make -f wruncblk.umf ede

	   For a runtime which includes the Acu4GL Oracle interface the
	   the resulting output will be a file named wruncblk_oracle7 or
	   wruncblke_oracle7 for an ede version.

		$ make -f wruncblk.umf oracle7
	   or
		$ make -f wruncblk.umf oracle7e

	2. To install. Replace the existing version of wruncbl (or wruncble)
	   with wruncblk, wruncblke, wruncblk_oracle7, or wruncblke_oracle7.
 
	   Edit $WISPCONFIG/wrunconfig to read:

		runcbl=wruncblk
	   or
		runcbl=wruncblk_oracle7
 
	3. Copy CONTROL/REPORT/INQUIRY/DATENTRY to a WISP runable directory
	   that should also include ACULINK and ACUUSING.


	Test your installation by running the utilites:
 
		$ wrun CONTROL
		$ wrun REPORT
		$ wrun INQUIRY
		$ wrun DATENTRY

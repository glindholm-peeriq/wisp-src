CRID for Acucobol NT/9x Setup
=============================

This document describes the steps for installing and setting up
the CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, and DATENTRY programs for Acucobol
on MicroSoft Windows NT/9x.


Overview
--------

1) Ensure WISP is installed first.
2) Install CRID for Acucobol.
3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.
4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.
5) Ensure ACUCONFIG is setup.


The Steps
---------

1) Ensure WISP is installed first.

    WISP must be installed first before you can install CRID.
    Ensure you have WISP installed and configured before
    continuing.

2) Install CRID for Acucobol.

    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
    b) Run A:SETUP

    The following instructions assume you have installed CRID in
    directory C:\CRIDACU298.  If you have installed CRID into a
    different location the adjust the instructions accordingly.

3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.

    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT V4.0 (or later) is installed and the
       Acucobol BIN directory is on the PATH.

          PATH %PATH%;C:\ACUCBL42\acugt\BIN

    b) Ensure Microsoft Visual C++ 5 or 6 (or later) is installed.

    c) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window

    d) In the MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window run the bat file
       Vcvars32.bat that came with MS Visual C++. This bat
       file enables you to compile and link C programs from
       the command prompt. 
       (Substitute path to Vcvars32.bat with the location used by
       Visual C++) 

       MSVC++ 5.x:
          C:> "C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\bin\Vcvars32.bat" x86  

       MSVC++ 6.x:
          C:> "C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC98\bin\Vcvars32.bat" x86  

       NOTE: If you get an out-of-space message, click on the
             properties button on the toolbar, go to the Memory tab,
             set the Initial Environment size to 4096, click OK, close
             the MSDOS/Command window, reopen and try again.

    e) Build the Acucobol runtime by following the instructions in
       the makefile.

       If you are using ACUCOBOL-GT 4.3 then follow the instructions
       in file C:\CRIDACU298\WRUN32WISP_CRID.MAK.

       If you are using ACUCOBOL-GT 4.2 or ealier then follow the
       instructions in C:\CRIDACU298\WWRUNCBL.MAK.


4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.

    Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
    directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
    runtime system.

           RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\WISP\ACU\WWRUNCBLK.EXE

    Substitute the actual server name inplace of "SERVER01" in the
    above example.

5) Ensure ACUCONFIG is setup.

    The Acucobol object files CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, and
    DATENTRY will be installed in the C:\CRIDACU298 directory.

    Ensure that the CRID directory is on Acucobols CODE-PREFIX
    or copy the four program files to a directory that is already
    on the CODE-PREFIX.

           CODE-PREFIX . \\SERVER01\CRIDACU298 ...

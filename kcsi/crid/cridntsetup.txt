	CRID for Acucobol NT/95 Setup
	=============================
	
	This document describes the steps for installing and setting up
	the CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, and DATENTRY programs for Acucobol
	on MicroSoft Windows NT/95.


	Overview
	--------

	1) Ensure WISP is installed first.
	2) Uninstall previous versions of CRID.
	3) Install CRID for Acucobol.
	4) Build WWRUNCBLK the Acucobol Runtime System.
	5) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.
	6) Ensure ACUCONFIG is setup.


	The Steps
	---------

	1) Ensure WISP is installed first.

	    WISP must be installed first before you can install CRID.
	    Ensure you have WISP installed and configured before
	    continuing.

	2) Uninstall previous versions of CRID.

 	    If CRID is already installed on this machine then first
	    uninstall the previous verion.  Use "Add/Remove programs" from
	    the Control Panel to remove the previous version.

	3) Install CRID for Acucobol.

	    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
	    b) Run A:SETUP

	    IMPORTANT: Install CRID into the same directory where WISP is
	    installed.  This will default to "C:\WISP".

	    The following instructions assume you have installed WISP in
	    directory C:\WISP .  If you have installed WISP into a
	    different location the adjust the instructions accordingly.

	4) Build WWRUNCBLK the Acucobol Runtime System.

	    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT V3.1 is installed and the Acucobol BIN
	       directory is on the PATH.

	          PATH %PATH%;C:\ACUCBL31\BIN

	    b) Ensure MicroSoft Visual C++ 4 is installed.
	    c) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window
	    d) Run C:\Msdev\Bin\Vcvars32.bat from Visual C++ to enable you
	       to build from the command prompt.
	    e) Change to the CRID directory: cd C:\WISP\CRIDACU.283
	    f) Edit WWRUNCBL.MAK 

	       Change ACUDIR to the location where Acucobol was installed.

	           ACUDIR=C:\ACUCBL31

	       Change KCSIDIR to the location where the CRID directory.

		   KCSIDIR=C:\WISP\CRIDACU.283

	    g) Issue the commands to build the Runtime.

	           C:> nmake /f wwruncbl.mak kcsi

	    h) The Runtime System WWRUNCBLK.EXE will have been created.

	5) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.

	    Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
	    directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
	    runtime system.

	           RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\WISP\CRIDACU.283\WWRUNCBLK.EXE

	    Substitute the actual server name inplace of "SERVER01" in the
	    above example.

	6) Ensure ACUCONFIG is setup.

	    The Acucobol object files CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, and
	    DATENTRY will be installed in the WISP\ACU directory.

	    Ensure that the ACUCONFIG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
	    directory has the WISP\ACU directory on the CODE-PREFIX.

                   CODE-PREFIX . \\SERVER01\WISP\ACU ...

        Summary:        Installation instructions for the CRID Utilities
			using the Micro Focus COBOL compiler.

        ====================================================================
 
 
	INSTALLATION
	============

        First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
        must be in place before CRID can be used.

        CRID will normally be distributed on diskette or tape as a
        compressed tar file named "cridmfx.XXXX.tar.Z".  It is recommended
        that you install CRID in your WISP directory ($WISPDIR). Unload
        this file from the distribution media as follows.

	        $ cd $WISPDIR
                $ tar -xvf /dev/rfd0

        Extract the distribution files from "cridmfx.XXXX.tar.Z" using the
        following command:

                $ uncompress -c cridmfx.XXXX.tar.Z|tar -xvpf -

        This will create a directory "cridmfx.XXXX" where XXXX is a version
	number.  Refer to packlist.txt in the distribution for a listing
	of expected files.
 

	Configuration
        -------------
 
	Copy the utilities to a program directory or a directory on
        your path.

	Test your installation by running the utilites:
 
		$ control
		$ report
		$ inquiry
		$ datentry
 
	NOTE:  If there is any problem running a utility, proceed to
               the steps for MAKING THE UTILITIES below.

        ====================================================================

	
	   *********************************************************
	   	The following instructions are only needed if
		you could not run the distribution executable 
		or if you need to relink the executable.
	   *********************************************************

	RELINKING THE UTILITIES
	-----------------------
 
	1. Copy the distribution into a directory on the user's path.
 
	2. Ensure that the Micro Focus COBOL compiler will run in this
	   directory.
 
	3. Once this is complete, you may build the individual utilities.

	   a.  Edit the make file cridmfx.umf.  The make file contains
	       instructions for building the utilities. This make file
	       needs to be edited to correctly reflect the location of
	       the wisp libraries.

	   b.  Locate the WISP libraries and edit the value for:
 
		WISPDIR=/usr/local/wisp

	4. Now the utilities may be built:

		$ make -f cridmfx.umf
 
	Follow the instructions on the screen for each utility that you
	wish to build.

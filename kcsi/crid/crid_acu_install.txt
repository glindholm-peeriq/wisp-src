Summary:        Installation instructions for the CRID Utilities
                using the ACUCOBOL compiler.

====================================================================


INSTALLATION
============

First install WISP and setup the WISP runtime environment.  This
must be in place before CRID can be used.  Create a standard 
ACUCOBOL WISP runtime by following the instructions supplied
with your WISP distribution. This will ensure that all current
pieces are up to date for WISP.

CRID will normally be distributed on CDROM as a tar file named
"crid_acu_XXXX.tar".  It is recommended that you install CRID in your 
WISP directory ($WISPDIR). 

Extract the distribution files from "crid_acu_XXXX.tar" using the
following command:

        $ cd $WISPDIR
        $ tar -xvpf crid_acu_XXXX.tar

This will create a directory "crid_acu_XXXX" where XXXX is a version
number.  Refer to crid_packlist.txt in the distribution for a listing 
of expected files.


Configuration
-------------

1. Build an extended wisp runtime for the CRID utilities:

   Read the wruncbl.umf file to determine the method for building
   the needed runtime.  The resulting output will be a file named
   wruncblk or wruncblke for an EDE version of the runtime.

        $ make -f wruncbl.umf crid
   or
        $ make -f wruncbl.umf cride

2. Point to the new runtime by editing $WISPCONFIG/wrunconfig and
   setting "runcbl" to the location of the wruncblk.

   Edit $WISPCONFIG/wrunconfig to read:

        runcbl=/usr/local/wisp_XXXX/crid_acu_XXXX/wruncblk

   Use the file path to wruncblk that is correct for your
   installation. 

3. The files CONTROL/REPORT/INQUIRY/DATENTRY should be on your $PATH
   and on the Acucobol CODE-PREFIX. 

   Add the CRID installaton directory to your $PATH:

       $ PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/wisp_XXXX/crid_acu_XXXX

   Add the CRID installation directory to the Acucobol CODE-PREFIX in
   the Acucobol config file $A_CONFIG (usually $WISPCONFIG/ACUCONFIG).

   E.g. Edit $WISPCONFIG/ACUCONFIG:

       CODE-PREFIX /usr/local/wisp_XXXX/crid_acu_XXXX ...


Test your installation by running the utilites:

        $ wrun CONTROL
        $ wrun REPORT
        $ wrun INQUIRY
        $ wrun DATENTRY

	CHANGES FROM 2.96 TO 2.97
	=========================
	The REPORT utility was unable to properly handle duplicate
	field names when multiple control files were used.  This has
	been corrected.


	CHANGES FROM 2.95 TO 2.96
	=========================
	The REPORT utility function "Print a Report" would garble the
	screen when Output DEVICE = DISPLAY was set.  The DISPLAY utility
	would run and when finished the REPORT screens would have parts of
	the display visable on the screen.  This problem has been
	corrected when linked with version 4.3.04 of the WISP library.


	CHANGES FROM 2.94 TO 2.95
	=========================
	For the ACUCOBOL version of CRID the cobol sources were compiled
	with the -C32 and -Z32 flags to allow CRID to be used with a
	version 3.2 of ACUCOBOL runtime system.

	CRID for Micro Focus was failing to properly mark a relative
	record deleted. This has been corrected.


	CHANGES FROM 2.93 TO 2.94
	=========================
	An error was introduced in 2.93 that caused data files with
	non-duplicate alternate keys to be flagged as duplicate alternate
	keys.  This could cause a data file to appear to not match it's
	control file.  This only effects CRID for Micro Focus version 2.93
	and has been corrected in this release.


	CHANGES FROM 2.92 TO 2.93
	=========================
	DATENTRY for Micro Focus COBOL: was failing on DIGITAL UNIX,
	SOLARIS and SCO when used with CISAM files. This has been
	corrected.

	DATENTRY for Micro Foucs COBOL: The create file option was not
	adding the duplicate flag for duplicate alternate keys. This has
	been corrected.

	DATENTRY for Micro Focus COBOL: On exit a Signal 11 would
	sometimes occur. This has been corrected.


	CHANGES FROM 2.91 TO 2.92
	=========================
	DATENTRY was not correctly handling non-updateable fields with an
	occurs value.

	DATENTRY was sometimes failing when displaying numeric fields with
	no decimal positions before the decimal point. (e.g. PIC .999)


	CHANGES FROM 2.90 TO 2.91
	=========================
	Upgrade to WISP 4.2.00


	CHANGES FROM 2.84 TO 2.90
	=========================
	Micro Focus COBOL:  The file I/O is now processed through the
	use of the extended file handler ExtFH().  DISAM is no longer a
	requirement for building the tools.  The ability to now process
	the extended file formats IDXFORMAT"3" and IDXFORMAT"4" files
	is now available.


	CHANGES FROM 2.83 TO 2.84
	=========================
	Added support for RDBMS when using Acu4GL.

	To use:  There is no additional configuration required for use with
	the Acu4GL interface.  Make sure the runtime configuration for
	Acu4GL is properly setup.  Create a new runtime which includes the
	appropriate file systems.

	RESTRICTIONS:

	- Control and Report files will remain in the Vision file system.

	- XFD file name must match the Wang style file name.

	CONTROL and REPORT previously were limited to 300 fields, this has
	been increased in 2.79 to allow up to 500 fields.

KCSI for Acucobol on Windows Setup
==================================

This document describes the steps for installing and setting up
the CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, DATENTRY and CREATE programs for 
Acucobol on Windows (WIN32).


Overview
--------

1) Ensure WISP is installed first.
2) Install KCSI for Acucobol.
3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.
4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.
5) Ensure ACUCONFIG is setup.


The Steps
---------

1) Ensure WISP 4.4.07 is installed first.

    WISP 4.4.07 must be installed first before you can install KCSI.
    Ensure you have WISP installed and configured before
    continuing.

2) Install KCSI for Acucobol.

    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
    b) Run A:SETUP

    The following instructions assume you have installed KCSI in
    directory C:\kcsiacuXXXX where XXXX is the version number.  
    If you have installed KCSI into a different location the adjust 
    the instructions accordingly.

3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.

    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT V5.2 (or later) is installed and the
       Acucobol BIN directory is on the PATH.

          PATH %PATH%;C:\Acucorp\Acucbl520\acugt\bin

    b) Ensure Microsoft Visual C++ 6 (or later) is installed.

    c) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window

    d) In the MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window run the bat file
       Vcvars32.bat that came with MS Visual C++. This bat
       file enables you to compile and link C programs from
       the command prompt. 
       (Substitute path to Vcvars32.bat with the location used by
       Visual C++) 

       MSVC++ 6.x:
          C:> "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\bin\
              Vcvars32.bat"

       NOTE: If you get an out-of-space message, click on the
             properties button on the toolbar, go to the Memory tab,
             set the Initial Environment size to 4096, click OK, close
             the MSDOS/Command window, reopen and try again.


    e) Build the Acucobol runtime by following the instructions in
       the makefile C:\kcsiacuXXXX\WRUN32WISP_KCSI_ACU52.MAK.


4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.

    Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
    directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
    runtime system.

           RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\ACUCOBOL\ACUGT\BIN\WRUN32WISPK.EXE

    Substitute the actual server and share name inplace of 
    "\\SERVER01\ACUCOBOL" in the above example.


5) Ensure ACUCONFIG is setup.

    The Acucobol object files CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, DATENTRY
    and CREATE will be installed in the C:\kcsiacuXXXX directory.

    Ensure that the KCSI directory is on Acucobols CODE-PREFIX
    or copy the four program files to a directory that is already
    on the CODE-PREFIX.

           CODE-PREFIX . \\SERVER01\kcsiacuXXXX ...

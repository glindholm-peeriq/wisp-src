KCSI for Acucobol on Windows Setup
==================================

This document describes the steps for installing and setting up
the CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, DATENTRY and CREATE programs for 
Acucobol on Windows (WIN32).


Overview
--------

1) Ensure WISP is installed first.
2) Install KCSI for Acucobol.
3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.
4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.
5) Ensure the PATH is setup.


The Steps
---------

1) Ensure WISP 5.1.00 is installed first. [WISPVER]

    WISP 5.1.00 must be installed first before you can install KCSI.
    Ensure you have WISP installed and configured before
    continuing.

2) Install KCSI for Acucobol.

    Unzip the distribution file kcsiacu4200.zip to the installation directory.

    The following instructions assume you have installed KCSI in
    directory C:\KCSIACUxxxx where xxxx is the version number.  
    If you have installed KCSI into a different location the adjust 
    the instructions accordingly.

3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.

    Follow the build instructions for your version of 
    Acucobol.

       For Acucobol-GT 10.2 see:
        - C:\KCSIACUxxxx\acu102\build_kcsi_acu102_rts.txt


4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.

    Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
    directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
    runtime system.

           RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\ACUDIR\BIN\WRUN32.EXE
	   or
           RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\ACUDIR\BIN\WRUN32WISPK.EXE

    Substitute the actual server and share name inplace of 
    "\\SERVER01\ACUDIR" in the above example.


5) Ensure the PATH is setup.

    The Acucobol object files CONTROL, REPORT, INQUIRY, DATENTRY
    and CREATE will be installed in the C:\KCSIACUxxxx directory.

    Ensure that the KCSI directory is on the PATH.  Use WCONFIG.exe
    to set the PATH or use the $WISPLINKPATH environment variable.

    Alternatively you could copy these files into the WISP bin
    directory (\\SERVER01\WISP\bin).

	Release Notes for EDE V1.0

	IDSI is pleased to release EDE V1.0. There are some changes
	from the pre-release and field-test versions of the product
	which require that programs written to use EDE be changed.

	These include:

    1.	The menu type, if defined as 0, used to default to be a
	pop-up menu. This has been changed, the default menu type
	is now what ever the appropriate root menu is for the
	target environment. On character cell terminals, the
	default type is a bar menu.

	If programs were written to default to pop-up, then they
	must be changed to explicitly specify pop-up.

    2.	The maximum number of menu items has been increased from
	16 to 20. Therefore, programs that have allocated menu
	control blocks with room for only 16 items must be
	increased to provide for 20.

	NOTE: FAILURE TO INCREASE MCB STORAGE TO 20 CAN RESULT
	IN UNPREDICTABLE CRASHES OF THE PROGRAM.

    3.	PF key responses are now biased by 100,000, rather than
	10,000. When decomposing PF keys from menu values, use the
	new 100,000 factor. I.e. RESPONSE = (PFKEY*100000)+VALUE.

    4.	A number of useful routines such as MENUINFO have been
	added to make the use of dynamic menus much easier.

    5.	On-line help has been changed such that rather than
	encoding a file name directly from the row, column,
	screen and program, it is now vectored through a file.
	This change is not significant for SFREU041 based
	systems (special customer code).

    6.	An extensive demo of the menuing and on-line help, including
	COBOL source code, is now included with EDE.

    7.	Routines for saving and restoring screen areas have been
	added and are preferable to using VPUSHSCR and VPOPSCR
	in that they use the optimizer and do not clear the
	screen unless necessary.

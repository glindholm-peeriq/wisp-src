Menu Width
----------
Width of the menu. Normally, the EDE menu manager determines
the width of a menu based on the width of the longest line
of text. If the Menu Width is specified, then the width of
the menu will be set to that value regardless of the length
of the longest text.

For bar menus, the width field specifies the spacing between
each item.

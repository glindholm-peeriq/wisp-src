	EDE ON-LINE DOC
	===============

	This document describes how to hook in a custom on-line	doc routine
	into EDE for use on VAX, or unix using ACUCOBOL or Micro Focus.

	The scheme used is slightly different then earlier versions.
	The EDE help system now calls a routine EDEOLDOC to provide the
	on-line doc services.  EDEOLDOC is a generic frontend that can be
	setup to call the actual on-line doc routine supplied by the user.
	If no special action is taken then EDEOLDOC will simply exist as
	a stub routine which will issue a warning message when called.

	To hook in a custom on-line doc routine you must edit the edeoldoc.c
	file so that it calls your routine, then compile it and replace
	it into the library.  Then rebuild your executables/runtime with
	the new version of the library.


	STERLING
	========

	The changes have been made to edeoldoc.c to use SFREU041, they are
	however enclosed in condition code (ifdef's).  The file edeoldoc.c
	will still need to be compiled specifically for the COBOL you are
	using.



	VAX
	===
	Compile EDEOLDOC.C with "STERLING" defined, replace the object into
	WISPLIB.OLB then rebuild you EXE's using the new WISPLIB and include
	the SFREU041 object file in the link.

		CC/DEFINE=STERLING EDEOLDOC.C
		LIBRARY/REPLACE WISPLIB.OLB EDEOLDOC.OBJ
		

	ACUCOBOL
	========
	Compile edeoldoc.c with "STERLING" and "ACU" defined, replace the
	object into libede.a then rebuild the ACUCOBOL runtime (wruncble).
	(You will need to use the latest sub85.c file when rebuilding the
	runtime.)

		cc -DSTERLING -DACU -c edeoldoc.c
		ar -rvs libede.a edeoldoc.o

	Micro Focus
	===========
	Compile edeoldoc.c with "STERLING" and "MF" defined, then replace
	the object into libede.a .  You will have to compile your SFREU041
	routine to native object file (sfreu041.o) and include it into
	your Micro Focus runtime (wrunmfe) along with the new libede.a .
	This is done by editing the file wrunmf.umf file and adding
	the file "sfreu041.o" to the end of the "SUBS=" list then remaking
	the runtime.  (SUBS=wrunmf.o wispmf.o sfreu041.o)
	(At present there is no support for having SFREU041 be a ".int"
	or ".gnt" file.)

		cc -DSTERLING -DMF -c edeoldoc.c
		ar -rvs libede.a edeoldoc.o
		cob -c sfreu041.cob


	UNIX KIT
	========

	The following files are being sent as part of the custom modifcations
	done for unix.

	edeoldoc.c	- interface to custom on-line doc routine (SFREU041)
	sub85.c		- updated Acucobol interface
	libede.a	- updated EDE library (with generic edeoldoc.o)

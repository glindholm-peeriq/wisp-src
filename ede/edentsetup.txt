	EDE for NT/95 Setup
	===================

	This document describes the steps for installing and setting up
	EDE on Microsoft Windows NT/95.


	Overview
	--------

	1) Ensure WISP is installed first.
	2) Uninstall previous versions of EDE.
	3) Install EDE for NT/95.
	4) Build WWRUNCBLE the Acucobol Runtime System.
	5) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.


	The Steps
	---------

	1) Ensure WISP is installed first.

	    WISP must be installed first before you can install EDE.
	    Ensure you have WISP installed and configured before
	    continuing.

	2) Uninstall previous versions of EDE.

 	    If EDE is already installed on this machine then first
	    uninstall the previous verion.  Use "Add/Remove programs" from
	    the Control Panel to remove the previous version.

	3) Install EDE for NT/95.

	    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
	    b) Run A:SETUP

	    IMPORTANT: Install EDE into the same directory where WISP is
	    installed.  This will default to "C:\WISP".

	    The following instructions assume you have installed WISP in
	    directory C:\WISP .  If you have installed WISP into a
	    different location the adjust the instructions accordingly.

	4) Build WWRUNCBLE the Acucobol Runtime System.

	    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT V3.1 (or later) is installed and the
	       Acucobol BIN directory is on the PATH.

	          PATH %PATH%;C:\ACUCBL31\BIN

	    b) Ensure MicroSoft Visual C++ 4 (or later) is installed.
	    c) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window
	    d) Run C:\Msdev\Bin\Vcvars32.bat from Visual C++ to enable you
	       to build from the command prompt.
	    e) Change to the ACU directory: cd C:\WISP\ACU
	    f) Edit WWRUNCBL.MAK 

	       Change ACUDIR to the location where Acucobol was installed.

	           ACUDIR=C:\ACUCBL31

	    g) Issue the commands to build the EDE Runtime.

	           C:> nmake /f wwruncbl.mak ede

	    h) The Runtime System WWRUNCBLE.EXE will have been created.

	5) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.

	    Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
	    directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
	    runtime system.

	           RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\WISP\ACU\WWRUNCBLE.EXE

	    Substitute the actual server name inplace of "SERVER01" in the
	    above example.

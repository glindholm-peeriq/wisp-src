WISP EDE for Windows Setup
==========================

This document describes the steps for installing and setting up
WISP EDE on Windows (WIN32).


Overview
--------

1) Ensure WISP is installed first.
2) Install WISP EDE for Windows.
3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.
4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.


The Steps
---------

1) Ensure WISP 4.4.02 is installed first.

    WISP 4.4.02 must be installed first before you can install EDE.
    Ensure you have WISP installed and configured before
    continuing.

2) Install WISP EDE for Windows.

    a) Insert Disk 1 into floppy drive A:
    b) Run A:SETUP

    The following instructions assume you have installed EDE in
    directory C:\EDE4402 .  If you have installed EDE into a
    different location the adjust the instructions accordingly.

3) Build the Acucobol Runtime System.

    a) Ensure ACUCOBOL-GT V4.0 (or later) is installed and the
       Acucobol BIN directory is on the PATH.

          PATH %PATH%;C:\Acucorp\Acucbl520\acugt\bin

    b) Ensure MicroSoft Visual C++ 6 (or later) is installed.

    c) Create an MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window

    d) In the MSDOS/COMMAND prompt window run the bat file
       Vcvars32.bat that came with MS Visual C++. This bat
       file enables you to compile and link C programs from
       the command prompt. 
       (Substitute path to Vcvars32.bat with the location used by
       Visual C++) 

       MSVC++ 6.x:
          C:> "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\VC98\bin\
              Vcvars32.bat"

       NOTE: If you get an out-of-space message, click on the
             properties button on the toolbar, go to the Memory tab,
             set the Initial Environment size to 4096, click OK, close
             the MSDOS/Command window, reopen and try again.

    e) Build the Acucobol runtime by following the instructions in
       the makefile.

       If you are using ACUCOBOL-GT 5.2 then follow the 
       instructions in file C:\EDE4402\WRUN32WISP_EDE_ACU52.MAK.

       If you are using ACUCOBOL-GT 5.1 then follow the 
       instructions in file C:\EDE4402\WRUN32WISP_EDE_ACU51.MAK.

       If you are using ACUCOBOL-GT 4.2 or ealier then follow the
       instructions in C:\EDE4402\WWRUNCBL.MAK.

4) Setup the WRUN.CFG configuration file.

    Edit the WRUN.CFG configuration file in the WISPCONFIG
    directory and change the RUNCBL= option to point to the new
    runtime system.

           RUNCBL=\\SERVER01\ACUCOBOL\ACUGT\BIN\WRUN32WISPE.EXE

    Substitute the actual server and share name inplace of 
    "\\SERVER01\ACUCOBOL" in the above example.
